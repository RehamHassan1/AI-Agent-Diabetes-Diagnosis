        "Abstract":"Estimating the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is critical in the medical decision-making process. This study aimed to use a machine learning technique combined with proteomics to develop personalized models for predicting CVD in patients with T2DM. In total, 874 patients with T2DM and 2,920 Olink proteins obtained from the UK Biobank were used in this study. Proteins were screened using Cox regression and LASSO regression. A basic model containing clinical features and a full model combining proteome and clinical features were constructed using the random survival forest algorithm. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the models and compare them with other CVD predictive models. Compared with the basic model, the full model performed better in predicting CVD, with time-dependent AUCs of 0.81 (3\u2009years), 0.74 (5\u2009years) and 0.74 (10\u2009years) (0.77, 0.69 and 0.67). We calculated the risk scores of the Framingham, ASCVD and Score2-Diabetes models. The results revealed that the prediction performance of the full model was also better than that of the abovementioned models. In terms of differentiation accuracy, the results of the net reclassification improvement index and integrated discrimination improvement index showed that the full model can identify high-risk individuals more accurately (accuracy rate: 79% vs. 69%). Proteomics can be used to predict cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. It is also necessary to consider the applicability of the model due to the limitations of the sample size and the constraints of proteomics in clinical applications."

        "Abstract":"With the increasing incidence of early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the significant burden of renal complications in younger patients, this study aimed to investigate the association between the age at onset of T2DM and the risks of renal complications. Two retrospective cohort studies were conducted among adults without chronic kidney disease (CKD) from 2008 to 2013, utilising electronic health records from the United Kingdom (UK) and Hong Kong (HK). A total of 124\u2009610 and 183\u2009114 patients newly diagnosed with T2DM were included in the T2DM group, and 4\u2009968\u2009819 and 3\u2009290\u2009862 individuals without diabetes were included in the comparison group for the UK and HK cohorts, respectively. Participants were categorised into six age groups at baseline (18-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and \u2265\u200980\u2009years). Propensity score fine stratification weights were applied within each age group, and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between T2DM and the risks of renal complications, including CKD, renal decline, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Over a median followup of 11.6\u2009years (approximately 57 million person-years) in the UK cohort and 9.7\u2009years (approximately 35 million person-years) in the HK cohort, T2DM was associated with an increased risk of CKD, renal decline, and ESRD. However, the risks decreased with increasing age at T2DM onset. In the UK cohort, the hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for the three outcomes among individuals with T2DM onset at 18-39\u2009years versus those without diabetes were 1.87 (1.65, 2.11), 4.87 (4.38, 5.40), and 4.49 (3.03, 6.68), respectively. For individuals with T2DM onset at \u226580\u2009years, the HRs decreased to 1.26 (1.21, 1.32), 1.66 (1.55, 1.78), and 1.48 (1.12, 1.96), respectively. A similar trend was observed in the HK cohort, with risks for all outcomes decreasing as the age of T2DM onset increased. Early-onset T2DM is associated with substantially higher risks of CKD, renal decline, and ESRD, underscoring the need for targeted prevention and management strategies to reduce renal complications in younger patients with T2DM."

Women aged 18-49 years who visited participating general practices three or more times during the study period (1 January 2011 - 31 July 2022). Age-standardised incidence of initial GLP-1 receptor agonist prescribing, by year and type 2 diabetes status; proportion of women using highly effective contraception at the time of GLP-1 receptor agonist initiation (contraception overlap); age-standardised incidence of pregnancy within six months of the first prescribing of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Of 1\u2009635\u2009684 women aged 18-49 years, 18\u2009010 (1.1%) were first prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists during 2011-2022, of whom 3739 (20.8%) had type 2 diabetes. The age-standardised incidence of GLP-1 receptor agonist prescribing for women with type 2 diabetes increased from 13.0 per 1000 women in 2011 to 88.5 per 1000 women in 2022; for women without type 2 diabetes, it increased from 0 to 14.9 per 1000 women. Of the 6293 women first prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists during 2022, 6954 (90.5%) did not have type 2 diabetes. Contraception overlap with first prescribing of GLP-1 receptor agonists was determined for 3825 women (21.2%). Pregnancies within six months of GLP-1 receptor agonist prescribing were documented for 232 of 10\u2009781 women for whom at least six months of follow-up data were available. The prescribing of GLP-1 receptor agonists for women of reproductive age is increasing in Australia, and most prescriptions are for women not diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Fewer than one in four women are using contraception at the time of treatment initiation, and a considerable number are pregnant within six months of the initial prescribing of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Further evidence and guidelines are needed to support the safe and effective use of GLP-1 receptor agonists by women of reproductive age."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes-related foot ulceration (DFU) represents a significant and increasing cause of morbidity and economic burden to health services. Surgical offloading has shown great effectiveness in the prevention and healing of DFU. The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of submetatarsal plantar fat pad modulation in preventing DFU and to characterise the different biomaterials used to this end. The study was registered on PROSPERO. A search strategy of the PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane biomedical databases was conducted. Any study which explored the modulation of the plantar submetatarsal fat pad for the prevention or treatment of DFU in adults was included. The main outcome was the occurrence of ulceration following intervention. Of the 3162 retrieved studies, 10 studies met inclusion criteria, describing outcomes for 76 participants with 112\u00a0ulcers or pre-ulcerative areas. Four studies report results of injectable liquid silicone in 55 participants, four studies included the use of an acellular allograft in eight participants, two studies included autolipotransplantation in 11 participants and one study reports on the use of injectable collagen in two participants. Only one randomised control trial was identified while the remainder of the studies were observational, case-series, or case-reports. The overall ulcer occurrence was 27\/112\u00a0over an average follow-up of 32.4\u00a0months. While plantar fat pad modulation shows promise as a surgical offloading strategy for DFU, insufficient high-quality trial data preclude meaningful interpretation of its merits. This is further complicated by heterogeneity in the biomaterial employed for modulation."

We aimed to determine whether pathological PSS, alone or in combination with global longitudinal strain (GLS), is a prognostic factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with type 2 diabetes. We prospectively investigated 364 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 55-65\u00a0years in the CARDIPP study. All patients underwent echocardiography between 2005 and 2009. PSS, measured by speckle tracking echocardiography, was defined as myocardial contraction after aortic valve closure. Pathological PSS was defined as a post-systolic index\u2009>\u20095% and was calculated as follows: [(maximum longitudinal strain - peak systolic longitudinal strain)\/(maximum longitudinal strain)]. The endpoint was any MACE, defined as hospitalization or death due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, hypertension, smoking, previous cardiovascular events, and HbA1c level. The mean follow-up time was 11.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u00a0years. Pathological PSS was associated with an increased risk of MACEs after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.11-4.37). Subjects with reduced GLS, PSS and GLS combined in a risk prediction model, had an adjusted HR for MACEs of 2.94 (95% CI 1.33-6.52). Our results suggest that PSS may provide additional prognostic information for patients with T2D when used alone or in combination with GLS."

This study evaluates the impact of tailored education on adherence and glycemic control among pediatric CSII users. This interventional analytical study included 30 patients diagnosed with T1D with age ranged from 5 to 18 years, recruited from Diabetes & Endocrinology Clinic at tertiary university-based children's hospital. Patients were recruited for one year duration. Patients who were on multiple daily injection (MDI) for 2 to 10 years were shifted to CSII after receiving comprehensive diabetes education. Their education level was assessed individually using a questionnaire to assess patients' knowledge and application skills at the time of insulin pump insertion, 3 and 6 months later. Twenty-five patients were on mini-med 715, 10 patients used flash glucose monitoring, and 15 patients used self-monitoring blood sugar, while five patients were on mini-med 780G and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using guardian 4 (G4).

        "Abstract":"Cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials have shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce CV mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We previously found that 4\u00a0weeks of SGLT2i treatment increased coronary flow reserve (CFR) by 30% and reduced epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness by 19% in T2DM patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, long-term effects remain unclear. This pilot study aimed to assess the long-term impact of dapagliflozin on CFR and EAT thickness in T2DM patients with CAD. Patients with T2DM and stable CAD were enrolled in the DAPAHEART trial, a single-center, 4-week, randomized (1:1 dapagliflozin 10\u00a0mg vs. placebo), double-blind, controlled study. At the end of the trial, placebo group patients also transitioned to dapagliflozin. CFR and EAT thickness were measured at baseline, after 4\u00a0weeks, and after 4\u00a0years using <sup>13<\/sup>N-ammonia PET\/CT. CFR increased 34.4% after 4\u00a0years (from 2.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19 at baseline to 2.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.001) with 29.18% reduction in EAT thickness (p\u2009=\u20090.03). BMI decreased in all patients (p\u2009=\u20090.001), but changes in BMI and EAT thickness were not significantly correlated (R<sup>2\u2009<\/sup>=\u20090.0662; p\u2009=\u20090.5), suggesting a weight-independent effect of dapagliflozin on EAT. The 30% CFR improvement seen after 4\u00a0weeks of dapagliflozin persisted at 4\u00a0years, together with a significant reduction in EAT thickness, possibly explaining CFR improvement. Similar results in the placebo group after treatment strongly support a causal relationship and underscore the long-term CV benefits of dapagliflozin and its role in reducing CV risk in T2DM patients."

Methods include self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM). To assess the efficacy of isCGM versus SMBG in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy. We conducted a systematic review including randomized controlled trials involving patients over 4 years old with T1DM or T2DM on multiple daily insulin regimens, comparing isCGM to SMBG. The outcomes analyzed were HbA1c (%), time below the target glucose range (TBR), patient satisfaction (DTSQ), device-related adverse events, time in range (TIR), and hypoglycemic events. Searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Two independent reviewers screened studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. The meta-analyses employed a random-effects model, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated via the GRADE system. Seventeen studies with 1,860 participants were included. The isCGM demonstrated a moderate certainty of evidence for reducing HbA1c (Mean difference [MD]: -0.25%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: -0.39- -0.10%; I\u00b2: 82.6% 13 studies; 1,482 patients) and enhancing patient satisfaction (MD: 4.5, 95% CI: 2.18- 6.82; I\u00b2: 92.9%; 10 studies; 1,150 patients). Meta-regression revealed that intervention duration was a significant moderator of HbA1c reduction. isCGM also favored a reduction in TBR, with an MD of -0.15% (95% CI: -0.23- -0.07%; I\u00b2: 96.7% 8 studies; 1,094 patients; low certainty). Mild device-related adverse events were more common in the isCGM group (Relative risk: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.5- 4.81; I\u00b2: 0%; 7 studies; 991 participants; moderate certainty). The overall frequency of participants who discontinued isCGM due to cutaneous adverse events was 1% (95% CI: 0-6%; 7 studies; 533 participants).

Compared with SMBG, isCGM reduces HbA1c, enhances patient satisfaction, and reduces TBR. However, it may increase the incidence of mild device-related adverse events. No definitive effects were observed on the TIR or hypoglycemia frequency. CRD42024562805."

Having a validated questionnaire that is culturally and linguistically appropriate in this field would nurture research in this area and contribute to better patient health outcomes. This study investigated the psychometric features of the Autonomy in Relatedness Inventory (ARI) among individuals with T2DM in Jordan. We used a secondary dataset on self-management and outcomes of individuals with T2DM to examine the psychometric properties of the ARI. The ARI's items' overall reliability was assessed using internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to evaluate the validity of the ARI. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the yielded factors. The ARI demonstrated high reliability (Cronbach's alpha value was 0.90) and validity in T2DM patients. Convergent validity of the ARI was established. The findings showed that ARI was strongly correlated with functional social support (r\u2009=\u2009.61, p\u2009<\u2009.001), in addition to negative correlations with depression (r= -.26, p\u2009<\u2009.001), anxiety (r= -.18, p\u2009<\u2009.001), and stress (r= -.24, p\u2009<\u2009.001).

        "Abstract":"The metabolic benefits of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in clinical application are well established; however, there is dearth of knowledge on their impact on adipokine regulation. This study investigated the effect of enavogliflozin on adiponectin and leptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. This secondary analysis of a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated changes in serum adiponectin and leptin over 24 weeks. Analysis of covariance was used with baseline values and weight change as covariates to examine whether the effects of enavogliflozin persisted after adjusting for weight change. Correlations between adipokine changes and key metabolic parameters were also assessed. Over the 24 weeks, the enavogliflozin group showed increased adiponectin levels with a least squares (LS) mean difference of 0.98\u00a0mg\/L compared with the placebo group, while leptin levels showed a significant decrease with an LS mean difference of -2.99\u00a0\u00b5g\/L. Enavogliflozin significantly reduced leptin levels over 24 weeks after adjusting for weight change; however, adiponectin changes were not significant after adjusting for weight change. Adiponectin levels significantly increased across weight loss categories, but leptin showed no significant differences. Leptin changes over 24 weeks significantly were positively correlated with changes in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and homeostasis model assessment of \u03b2-cell function but significantly negatively correlated with changes in serum ketone and urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio. Enavogliflozin treatment decreased leptin over 24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes, and this effect remained significant after adjusting for weight change, suggesting an improved adipokine profile. Reductions in leptin were also associated with improvements in insulin resistance and increases in serum ketone levels. These results highlight enavogliflozin as a potential treatment beyond glycemic control, offering additional benefits in managing metabolic dysregulation associated with type 2 diabetes.

        "Abstract":"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), yet remain underutilized in clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate real-world treatment patterns and associated mortality outcomes among patients with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The CARdiovascular and DIABetes (CARDIAB) cohort included 138,397 patients with T2D and ASCVD. Patients were categorized into four treatment groups: (i) both SGLT2-I and GLP-1RA, (ii) SGLT2-I only, (iii) GLP-1RA only, and (iv) neither medication. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Of the 138,397 patients, 57% received neither SGLT2-I nor GLP-1RA, 17% received both, 20% received SGLT2-I only, and 6% received GLP-1RA only. Female sex, older age, non-coronary ASCVD, and absence of follow-up in specialized cardiology or diabetes clinics were associated with lower treatment rates. Compared to those receiving neither medication, all-cause mortality was significantly lower among patients treated with SGLT2-I only (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.27-0.29), GLP-1RA only (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.37-0.40) and both agents (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.16-0.18). This association remained significant following a multivariate analysis. In patients with T2D and ASCVD, treatment with SGLT2-I and GLP-1RA, especially in combination, is associated with a substantial reduction in mortality. These findings highlight significant gaps in implementation and the urgent need to optimize use of evidence-based therapies in this high-risk population."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased oxidative stress, which contributes to systemic dysfunction and respiratory muscle impairment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on oxidative stress and antioxidant activity in diabetic rats induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin. Male Wistar rats (n\u2009=\u200930) were divided into four groups: sedentary-sham (Sed-Sham, n\u2009=\u20098), respiratory muscle trained-sham (RMT-Sham, n\u2009=\u20098), sedentary-DM (Sed-DM, n\u2009=\u20097), and respiratory muscle trained-DM (RMT-DM, n\u2009=\u20097). DM was induced using a high-energy diet followed by a low-dose streptozotocin injection. The RMT protocol consisted of 30\u00a0min\/day, 5\u00a0days\/week, for 6\u00a0weeks, whereas the sedentary animals did not exercise. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and dichlorofluorescein (DCF) levels, while antioxidant capacity was evaluated through superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels in plasma and selected tissues. In DM rats, RMT significantly reduced TBARS levels in plasma and gastrocnemius muscle, indicating a decrease in lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, RMT partially restored antioxidant capacity, as evidenced by increased SOD activity in the lungs and elevated NPSH levels in the liver. In Sham rats, RMT also demonstrated beneficial effects, reducing TBARS levels in the gastrocnemius muscle and enhancing SOD activity in the kidneys. RMT attenuated oxidative stress in DM rats by reducing lipid peroxidation and enhancing antioxidant defenses. These findings suggest RMT as a potential non-pharmacological strategy to improve oxidative balance in rats with diabetes."

        "Abstract":"Perioperative euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) is a rare but life-threatening complication associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). It is characterised by ketonaemia, acidosis, and normal serum glucose. Whilst guidelines advise withholding SGLT2i prior to elective surgery, limited guidance exists for emergency procedures. This systematic review aimed to describe EuDKA cases following emergency surgery, identify patient characteristics, and examine contributing risk factors. A search of electronic databases up to April 2024 identified 30 cases from 21 publications. In most cases, EuDKA onset occurred within three days postoperatively (range: intraoperative to 10\u00a0days). Reported risk factors included inadequate SGLT2i withholding time, poor glycaemic control, morbid obesity, major surgery, intercurrent illness, suboptimal intraoperative diabetes management, and delayed gastrointestinal absorption. Morbidity was significant: ten patients required intensive care, two required intubation and ventilation, two received dialysis, and one underwent exploratory laparotomy. No deaths were reported. Due to atypical biochemical findings and non-specific symptoms, EuDKA remains under-recognised. Clinicians are advised to maintain a high index of suspicion, ensure appropriate perioperative insulin management, conduct vigilant laboratory monitoring, and provide patient education to reduce the risk in emergency surgical settings."

In this study, we investigate the presence of NARS2 variants in a large cohort of individuals with early-onset diabetes. We used genome and targeted next-generation sequencing to screen for rare, coding biallelic NARS2 variants in a cohort of 397 individuals diagnosed with diabetes <24\u2009months of age of unknown genetic cause. We identified 8 individuals with homozygous disease-causing missense variants in NARS2 (4 individuals with the p.(Phe216Leu) variant, 3 with p.(Thr180Asn) and one with p.(Val440Leu)). All 8 individuals were diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes before 6\u2009months of age (neonatal diabetes, NDM) with the median age at diagnosis being 4\u2009weeks (range: 1 to 20\u2009weeks). 7\/8 probands had low birthweight (median Z-score: -2.43, range: -4.17 to 0.86). Neurological features were common, with epilepsy and developmental delay each identified in 7\/8 and 6\/8 participants, respectively. Taken together with previously published cases, this study shows that NDM is an important feature of COXPD-24 and highlights a critical role for NARS2 in the insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2-cell."

        "Abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and obesity may co-exist in children and adolescents. Childhood obesity tends to persist into adulthood. Sustained weight loss is recommended for obesity and OSA but may be very difficult to achieve and maintain in the real world. The need to provide effective and integrated solutions for the constellation of associated pro-inflammatory and mechanical complications of obesity including obstructive sleep apnoea, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is obvious. Sleep laboratories cannot meet the demand for diagnostic polysomnograms and under resourced paediatric obesity clinics limit themselves to treating those with severe obesity. Importantly, readily accessible resources, such as community-based dietitians and other allied health professionals, are both scarce and overwhelmed by demands for their services. The result is that many families who need assistance, especially those with socio-economic disadvantage and those with neurodiverse children, are unable to access treatments in a timely and equitable manner. In adults, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been demonstrated to reduce body weight by up to 15\u00a0% in a 12-month period, improve glycaemic control, improve blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors and significantly decrease the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea. As part of an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach, GLP-1 RA treatment in the medium to long term may be useful in those adolescents with severe obesity and OSA who are unable, unwilling or unsuitable for treatment with adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]. Treatment benefits using GLP-1 RAs as adjunct therapy for OSA have been demonstrated in adults. The time has come to consider prioritising funded availability for adolescents with severe OSA and obesity in combination with support for behaviour change."

Trifolium pratense (TP) is a flowering herb with potent antioxidant and antidiabetic properties. The present study aimed to explore the diabetic-healing effects of TP-derived exosomes (TPDEs) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. TPDEs were isolated using polyethylene glycol precipitation and serial centrifugation and characterised. STZ-induced diabetic rats were treated with TPDE doses (0, 100, 200, and 400\u2009\u03bcg\/kg) for 28\u2009days. Biochemical factors (fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, C-peptide, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and nitric oxide (NO)) were evaluated in serum samples. Also, the expression of PDX1, insulin, NGN3, and SIRT1 genes in pancreas tissues was assessed using real-time PCR. TPDE treatment decreased the serum levels of FBS and NO while increasing c-peptide, insulin, and TAC levels. It also significantly enhanced the expression of insulin, PDX1, NGN3, and SIRT1 genes. TPDEs at doses of 100 to 200\u2009\u03bcg\/kg showed the most significant antidiabetic effects. TPDEs significantly improved diabetes-induced alterations in serum insulin levels, antioxidant status, and pancreas-related gene expression.

This study evaluated the association between a tobacco control policy and hospital admissions for stroke and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in hypertensive and T2DM individuals. Interrupted time series study. Beijing, China. 2\u2009144\u2009133 hypertensive and 1\u2009446\u2009750 T2DM patients residing in Beijing from January 2013 to June 2017. A comprehensive tobacco control policy package, incorporating all MPOWER components, was implemented in June 2015. Changes in admission rates and admissions for stroke and AMI. Patients with T2DM showed immediate decreases in stroke [-9.4% (95% confidence interval = -13.3% to -5.3%)] and AMI [-24.3% (-31.2% to -16.7%)] admission rates after the policy. Similarly, the immediate post-policy change in stroke and AMI admission rates for hypertensive patients was -7.5% (-10.9% to -3.9%) and -23.0% (-29.2% to -16.3%), respectively. However, these reductions did not differ from those without either condition (P-interaction >0.05). For long-term trends, significant decreases were only seen for stroke [T2DM: -32.9% (-39.9% to -25.1%); hypertension: -33.3% (-39.3% to -26.7%)], but not AMI admissions, and again did not differ from those without either disease (P-interaction >0.05). Compared with healthy controls without T2DM or hypertension, patients with both conditions showed greater long-term reductions in stroke admission rates [-29.2% (-37.0% to -20.5%) vs. -14.4% (-26.3% to -0.5%), P-interaction\u2009=\u20090.05), whereas the opposite trend was observed for AMI admissions [7.9% (-15.9% to 38.4%) vs. -29.9% (-46.9% to -7.3%), P-interaction\u2009=\u20090.02]. Beijing's 2015 comprehensive tobacco control policy appears to be associated with reduced acute myocardial infarction and stroke admissions among high-risk groups (individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension), although admission rates showed no statistically significant difference between high-risk and non-high-risk populations."

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia, the biochemical precursor to gout, is usually defined as the theoretical limit of solubility of serum uric acid (UA) of \uff1e7.0 mg\/dL. Hyperuricemia is closely associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, which are well known to be related to risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). Furthermore, hyperuricemia has been associated with increased mortality in both the general population and individuals with cardiovascular diseases. Elevated UA in patients with CAD is accompanied by surrogate markers of atherosclerosis, including C-reactive protein, platelet activation, and endothelial dysfunction, which can contribute to possible pathogenic links between hyperuricemia and subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. Similarly, patients with gout have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases than those without it, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Gout is a disease with variable levels of inflammation, driven by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Recent imaging technology has revealed that deposition of MSU crystals can occur in the coronary arteries as well as the joints. However, current evidence does not support the efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hyperuricemia; therefore, identifying individuals who may benefit from a sustained decrease in UA is crucial. We herein review the current understanding and future perspectives for management of hyperuricemia as a residual risk in patients with CAD."

A total of 203 hospitalized patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were selected from February to October 2023 and categorized into groups according to their urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Spearman correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to assess the relationship between 25(OH)D and UACR. Among the 203 T2DM patients included, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 59.1%. The 25(OH)D levels in the macroalbuminuria group 9.37 ng\/mL (5.98, 15.60) were significantly lower than those in the normal albuminuria group 18.26 ng\/mL (14.40, 23.52) and microalbuminuria group 18.20 ng\/mL (11.71, 24.20) with statistical significance (p<0.001). Spearman correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D and UACR (r=-0.173, p=0.014). Stepwise linear regression analysis, after adjusting for confounding factors, revealed a linear negative correlation between 25(OH)D and albuminuria (\u03b2=-0.278, p<0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, no association was identified between vitamin D deficiency and microalbuminuria in patients with T2DM. However, vitamin D deficiency may significantly increase the risk of macroalbuminuria in patients with T2DM,with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.747 (95% CI: 1.157-19.473). Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among the study population. Serum 25(OH)D levels exhibited a significant negative correlation with UACR, suggesting a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and an elevated risk of macroalbuminuria in individuals with T2DM."

        "Abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. Its pathological features include abnormal aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau proteins, neuronal loss, and brain atrophy. The \"amyloid hypothesis\" suggests that A\u03b2 accumulation triggers disease progression, leading to the development of anti-A\u03b2 antibody therapies. However, their effectiveness is limited once dementia has developed, highlighting the need for early intervention in the preclinical stage. This review focuses on type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance as acquired risk factors for AD, summarizing epidemiological and experimental evidence on their impact on AD neuropathology. While early postmortem studies produced inconsistent results regarding the association between T2D, insulin resistance, and A\u03b2 deposition, recent amyloid PET imaging studies have clarified this relationship in the human brain. Additionally, animal studies suggest that diet-induced insulin resistance promotes A\u03b2 accumulation. Conversely, genetic disruption of insulin signaling molecules significantly suppresses A\u03b2 pathology. These seemingly contradictory findings suggest that while reduced brain insulin signaling may inhibit A\u03b2 pathology, peripheral metabolic disturbances associated with worsening insulin resistance may accelerate A\u03b2 deposition. Understanding the multifaceted roles of insulin signaling and the molecular basis of these complex interactions is crucial for identifying new preventive and disease-modifying therapeutic targets. Advancing this knowledge is essential for developing innovative AD treatments."

        "Abstract":"The metal-chelating activity of metformin, which has long been known but of unclear clinical relevance, has recently been implicated in the pleiotropic effects, including antitumorigenic and anti-inflammatory actions, of the drug. However, whether metformin actually influences metal dynamics in humans has remained unknown. We here investigate whether metformin influences serum metal levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In this cross-sectional study, individuals with type 2 diabetes treated or not treated with metformin for at least 6 months were recruited. The primary outcome was the difference in serum copper concentration between metformin users and non-users. Secondary outcomes included differences in serum levels of iron, zinc, and vitamin B<sub>12<\/sub> as well as in copper-related and iron-related parameters between the two groups. A total of 189 individuals (93 metformin users and 96 non-users) were analyzed. Metformin users showed significantly lower serum copper (16.0 vs 17.8\u2009\u00b5mol\/L, p<0.001) and iron levels (16.3 vs 17.3\u2009\u00b5mol\/L, p=0.02) and higher zinc levels (13.3 vs 12.5\u2009\u00b5mol\/L, p=0.01) compared with non-users. Copper-related and iron-related parameters for metformin users were consistent with latent deficiencies of these metals. Serum homocysteine levels (12.2 vs 11.2\u2009\u00b5mol\/L, p=0.03) were significantly higher, whereas vitamin B<sub>12<\/sub> levels (338.7 vs 412.8\u2009pmol\/L, p<0.001) were significantly lower, in metformin users. Multiple regression analysis including variables that potentially influence metal dynamics identified metformin use as an independent predictor of serum copper (B = -1.54\u2009\u00b5mol\/L, p<0.001) and iron levels (B = -2.49\u2009\u00b5mol\/L, p=0.004). Metformin use was associated with reduced serum levels of copper and iron, as well as with increased serum zinc levels. These changes in metal dynamics may be related to the pharmacological effects of this widely administered drug."

We conducted clinical analysis of 208 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with OTUD3 genotyping, combined with diabetic homozygous mutated (Otud3<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) mouse models and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell lines (OTUD3 knockdown\/mutation). We found increased hyperreflective foci (HRF) associated with an increased immune activation in diabetic Otud3<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice compared to Otud3 wild-type (Otud3<sup>+\/+<\/sup>) mice. OTUD3 knockdown or mutated cells showed increased cell dysfunction and oxidative stress markers under inflammatory conditions. Further upstream transcription factors predict analysis suggest PPAR\u03b3 as the potential target of OTUD3. Finally, we found PPAR\u03b3 agonist could rescue the phenotype in RPE cells characterized by increased ROS levels, enhanced migration, and elevated apoptosis resulting from OTUD3 loss of function through knockdown or mutation. Our study offers novel insights into how deubiquitylase OTUD3 maintains the normal function of the retina by deubiquitylating PPAR\u03b3 and provides a novel therapeutic target for this vision-threatening diabetic complications."

Observational studies comparing patients with DM based on insulin therapy have reported inconsistent findings. This study compares the outcomes of patients with insulin-requiring DM (IRDM) and non-insulin requiring DM (NIRDM) based on high quality prospective data. Characteristics and outcomes of patients with IRDM and NIRDM enrolled in the BEST-CLI trial were compared. Cox regression model was used to determine the association between insulin requirement and outcomes. The analysis included 1,229 patients with DM among whom 67.7% (N=832) had IRDM. The mean age was 66.7 \u00b1 9.9 years, with the IRDM group being younger (65.8 vs 68.6, P<0.001) and more likely to be Hispanic (19% vs 13.1%, P=0.01). Patients with IRDM were more likely to have renal disease and prior minor amputation (20.9% vs 13.9%, P=0.003) but were less likely to be smokers (24.5% vs 38.3%, P<0.001) compared to NIRDM. Overall, only 26.8% of the cohort had adequate glucose control at study entry with patients in the NIRDM more likely to have a hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) level < 7 (19.2% vs 44%, P<0.001). Patients with IRDM had significantly higher wound grade and more advanced overall WIfI stage compared to patients with NIRDM. At three years, patients with NIRDM were more likely to achieve resolution of CLTI, but there were no differences in other outcomes. Two years after revascularization, glucose control continued to be suboptimal with only 37.3% of the cohort achieving HbA1c < 7. Regression analysis showed that insulin requirement was associated with decreased CLTI resolution (HR=0.86[0.75-0.99]) but not with other outcomes. Compared to endovascular therapy, open revascularization was associated with a lower risk of major amputation (HR=0.65[0.48-0.88]), major reintervention (HR=0.41[0.30-0.56]) and MALE or death (HR=0.78 [0.66-0.91]), irrespective of insulin therapy. A spline model demonstrated that open revascularization was associated with a lower HR of MALE or death compared to endovascular regardless of baseline HbA1c level. Patients with IRDM undergoing LER for CLTI present with worse glucose control and more advanced CLTI stage compared to NIRDM. Insulin requirement showed a modest association with the outcomes of revascularization in this cohort. Open revascularization was superior to endovascular in patients with DM, regardless of insulin therapy or HbA1c level."

In this study, YB is synthesized by optimizing the traditional method. Morphological and physicochemical characterization are performed using XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, EDAX, DLS, TGA-DSC, and FTIR. The antimicrobial activity of YB is assessed using the well diffusion technique against the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). The antioxidant potential is evaluated using the 1,1-Diphenyl-2-Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and Nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging assay. A chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay is performed on fertilized chick eggs to study the anti-angiogenesis potential of YB. The XRD patterns of YB showed the presence of cubic and hexagonal phases of ZnS having average crystallite size of 32.66\u00a0nm. XPS data supports the formation of ZnS phase of YB. SEM and TEM data confirmed the size of YB NPs in a range of 250-350\u00a0nm. The EDAX analysis confirmed the presence of Zn (37.2 %) and S (21.18 %). The mean particle diameter was 361\u00a0nm in DLS. TGA-DSC findings verified that the synthesized material is stable up to 435.80\u00a0\u00b0C. The FTIR confirms the presence of organic moieties in YB along with ZnS phase. YB effectively inhibited the growth of S. aureus and E. coli. The ability of YB to scavenge DPPH and NO radicals is found to be concentration dependent (50-250\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL). The study also demonstrated that YB has notable antioxidant activity. The disappearance of blood vessels beneath the sample-loaded disk after 7 days indicated the effective anti-angiogenic properties of YB. Altogether, YB exhibited significant antimicrobial, noteworthy antioxidant, and anti-angiogenic activities, indicating its potential as a promising therapeutic agent."

However, their effectiveness in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remains uncertain, and the implementation of this class has remained low, in part due to its side effects and tolerability profile. Emerging therapies that target the mineralocorticoid receptor and\/or the production of aldosterone may offer alternative strategies to treat the aldosterone-mineralocorticoid receptor axis. For instance, the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has shown efficacy in reducing cardiovascular and renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as well as decreasing the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction populations. Large-scale, direct comparative outcome studies are currently lacking that compare steroidal MRAs vs emerging therapies. This review critically assesses the structural and mechanistic distinctions between nonsteroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs as well as mineralocorticoid receptor modulators and aldosterone synthase inhibitors; summarizes available evidence across heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease populations; and highlights ongoing and forthcoming research aimed at addressing key unanswered questions in this rapidly evolving therapeutic field."

        "Abstract":"Endocrine disorders represent a serious public health problem and frequently can be caused by genetic factors or their combination with environmental and lifestyle factors. Assessment of relevant genetic factors is important to estimate the risk of endocrine pathologies in an individual before their manifestation. Identification of genetic variations in proteins of the major histocompatibility complex is important with regard to the autoimmune nature of many endocrine pathologies, including type\u00a01 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and 13 endocrine disorders by using experimental whole-exome sequencing profiles obtained for 895 patients from the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Moscow. In addition, the linkage disequilibrium of the identified alleles in the context of the respective diagnoses was assessed. We identified totally 45 statistically significant associations between HLA alleles and specific diagnoses of endocrine pathologies. Among them, 33 were described for the first time and 12 have been previously reported for type\u00a01 diabetes. Overall, 17 alleles were associated with type\u00a01 diabetes and four alleles - with other forms of diabetes. Furthermore, three alleles were associated with obesity, five - with adrenogenital diseases, three - with hypoglycemia, and three - with precocious puberty. Single alleles were found to be associated with congenital hypothyroidism without goiter, hyperfunction of pituitary gland, adrenomedullary hyperfunction, and short stature due to endocrine disorder. The study shows that early HLA typing can help in detecting genetic risk factors of endocrine disorders. In\u00a0addition, identification of disease associations with specific HLA alleles can broaden our understanding of\u00a0the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of relevant endocrine disorders."

        "Abstract":"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote blood-vessel repair, but their apoptosis worsens diabetes-related vascular damage. Although advanced glycation end products (AGEs) abound in diabetes, it remains unclear whether they trigger EPC apoptosis through oxidative stress and driven MAPK activation. EPCs were extracted from Sprague-Dawley rats' bone marrow. Cells were treated with varying AGEs concentrations (50, 100, 200 \u00b5g\/mL) and durations (6, 12, 24, 48 hours). Apoptosis was measured via Annexin V\/PI staining flow cytometry, and protein expression of Bax (pro-apoptotic) and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) was analyzed by Western blot. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected by flow cytometry using DCFH-DA molecular probes. The effects of antioxidants (NAC) and specific inhibitors (SP600125 for JNK and SB203580 for p38MAPK) on apoptosis and protein expression were also examined. EPC apoptosis increased with AGEs concentration and exposure time, peaking at 24 hours. Bax expression rose, while Bcl-2 decreased with higher AGEs levels and prolonged exposure. ROS generation increased up to 12 hours before declining. Antioxidant NAC reduced ROS and Bax expression. Inhibitors SP600125 and SB203580 decreased JNK and p38MAPK activation, lowered Bax, and increased Bcl-2 expression."

        "Abstract":"The purpose of this article was to evaluate the clinical impact of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) severity in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) who underwent distal open revascularization. This study included a single-center retrospective analysis of diabetic patients with CLTI who underwent distal revascularization between January 2012 and December 2019. The sample was divided into two groups according to DFU severity; group 1 was defined if observed Wound grade \u2265 2 and Infection grade \u2265 1 and group 2 was defined if observed Wound grade < 2 and Infection grade < 1, according to Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification. The primary endpoint was achieving freedom from CLTI at 1 year. Secondary endpoints encompassed the recurrence of CLTI, limb salvage, amputation-free survival, overall survival, and primary patency over a 4-year follow-up period. A total of 258 distal bypasses were performed in diabetic patients with CLTI. Among these, 95 patients had infected major foot lesions (group 1), while the remaining 163 limbs comprised group 2. Group 1 patients were slightly younger, with a median age of 72 years (IQR 14), compared to 74 years (IQR 14) in group 2 (p=0.045). Most of the patients achieved freedom from CLTI at 12 months (82%), with no significant differences between groups (HR 0.75, CI 0.53-1.04, p=0.084; aHR 0.77, CI 0.54-1.08, p=0.130). At 4 years of follow-up, recurrence rates of CLTI and limb salvage were no different between groups (HR 0.68, CI 0.34-1.35, p=0.266; aHR 0.71, CI 0.34-1.48, p=0.355 and HR 1.18, CI 0.63-2.24, p=0.591; aHR 1.81, CI 0.80-4.11, p=0.155, respectively). Survival-related end points were not different between groups, except when adjusted for baseline characteristics and graft type (survival: HR 1.50, CI 0.96-2.33, p=0.072; aHR 2.49, CI 1.54-4.05, p<0.001; amputation-free survival: HR 1.37, CI 0.97-1.92, p=0.071; aHR 2.03, CI 1.40-2.93, p<0.001). The present study emphasizes the value of distal revascularization in limb salvage of patients with diabetic foot, independently of the DFU severity. However, these results suggest a lower survival in patients with infected major foot lesions. Further studies are needed to assert these findings."

        "Title":"Using Pedal Acceleration Time To Predict Ischemic Wound Healing In Diabetic Patients.",
        "Abstract":"Diabetes Mellitus is one of the main factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), while also being associated with medial arterial calcification, thus limiting the use of the ankle-brachial index. Pedal acceleration time (PAT), has emerged as a diagnostic alternative, by measuring the systolic acceleration in the arteries of the foot, with higher PAT values corresponding to a worse prognosis and with the literature suggesting a cut-off of 180 ms as a predictor of wound healing. We aimed to confirm whether we could use PAT to predict wound healing, need for revascularization and amputation in diabetic patients and whether this cut-off was valid in our population. A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried on diabetic patients referred to our department with PAD and lower limb wounds. Each limb was assessed individually in case of bilateral wounds. Limbs with unmeasurable PAT were excluded. Limbs were assessed on follow-up and classified as: healed wounds (HW), non-healed wounds (NHW), revascularized or amputated. PAT cut-off for wound healing was measured with ROC curve. Significance was defined at p\u22640.05. A total of 88 patients and 100 limbs were included, mostly males (80.68%) with a median age of 75 years. Cut-off for wound healing was validated at 180.5 ms. Among the assessed limbs, 26% HW, 31% NHW, 33% revascularized limbs and 7% amputations. Mean PAT in each group was 159.81 ms (HW), 199.32 ms (NHW), 239.18 ms (revascularized), 279.14 ms (amputated). When comparing the HW and NHW groups, 61.3% of NHW had PAT >180ms versus 19.2% HW, p<0.001 (OR=6.65; 95%CI [1.98-22.39]). In the sub-set of NHW we further analysed whether the wound was clinically better or worse: wounds with a positive healing process had a mean PAT of 189.96 ms vs 231.43 ms (p=0.14) in wounds with worse evolution. The results of our study validate the cut-off of 180 ms and reinforce using PAT as a predictor for wound healing, even among diabetic patients. In our analysis, only patients with HW had mean PAT \u2264180 ms, with higher values of PAT being associated with worse outcomes (need for revascularization\/amputation). Furthermore, in NHW patients, those with a PAT closer to 180 ms were associated with more favourable wound healing outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Sarcopenic obesity, defined as the coexistence of reduced muscle mass and excess adiposity, may adversely affect bone health, especially in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to explore the association between different body composition phenotypes, particularly sarcopenic obesity, and bone mineral density (BMD) in this population. We retrospectively analyzed 573 postmenopausal women with T2DM hospitalized between September 2020 and October 2024. Based on appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) and body fat percentage (BFP) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), participants were classified into control, obesity alone, sarcopenia alone, and sarcopenic obesity groups. Associations between phenotypes and BMD were assessed using Spearman correlation, logistic regression, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models. The obesity group had the highest BMD, while the sarcopenia group had the lowest. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with significantly lower lumbar spine and hip BMD and a higher risk of osteoporosis. Obesity showed a protective effect (OR\u2009=\u20090.515, P\u2009=\u20090.002), whereas sarcopenic obesity increased osteoporosis risk (OR\u2009=\u20093.368, P\u2009=\u20090.007). RCS analysis revealed nonlinear relationships between ASMI, BFP, and BMD. Sarcopenic obesity significantly increases osteoporosis risk in postmenopausal women with T2DM, while isolated obesity may protect bone mass. Routine body composition assessment is essential for early identification and targeted intervention."

We aimed to explore sexual knowledge and contraceptive use and associated factors in T1D adolescents compared to healthy peers. Fifty- eight T1D adolescents (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD age 16.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 years, disease duration 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5 years) were compared to 116 healthy controls (matching 1:2 for school, age and gender). Anonymous questionnaires were used to evaluate sexual knowledge and contraceptive methods. The commonest contraceptive method at the last sexual contact was the condom. The use of birth pill was reported by 11.8% patients and by 8.3% controls, withdrawal was reported by 33.3% of T1D and 24% of controls, no protection by 23.5% patients and by 10.2% controls, while double protection (\u22652 methods) was reported by 35% patients and 27.7% controls. No study participant used long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). The high protection (dual protection) group was characterized by younger age and older age at sexual debut (16.4 vs 15.8 years, p\u2009=\u20090.010). The low protection group (no contraception\/withdrawal) was characterized by older patients' age (p\u2009=\u20090.023) and younger paternal age (p\u2009=\u20090.046). Among controls, the use of dual protection was more common in the group whose parents were married versus those with divorced parents (34.3 vs. 10%, p\u2009=\u20090.042). Among the study population, the condom was the commonest contraceptive method for both groups, while 23.5% of patients and 10.2% controls used no protection. The degree of contraception use among patients was associated with patients' age and parental age and with the family structure in controls. The above underline the necessity for health care professionals to provide sexual education and contraception counseling to young adolescents with T1D and their healthy peers."

We investigated whether distinct longitudinal AFI trajectories exist during pregnancy and their association with fetal growth. This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial included singleton pregnancies without pre-existing or gestational diabetes mellitus that received prenatal care at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei and its Hsin-Chu Branch in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Ultrasonography was performed at 22\u2009+\u20090 to 24\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks, 30\u2009+\u20090 to 32\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks, 35\u2009+\u20090 to 37\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks and at admission for delivery to measure fetal biometry and AFI. Neonatal anthropometrics and adiposity were measured at delivery. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct AFI trajectory patterns during pregnancy. Regression analysis was used to determine differences in fetal and neonatal parameters between AFI trajectory groups, with adjustment for confounders. Overall, 802 pregnancies were included. Two AFI trajectory patterns were identified: one characterized by gradually decreasing AFI during gestation and the other by gradually increasing AFI. On linear regression analysis, compared with the decreasing AFI trajectory, increasing AFI was associated with higher gestational-age-specific Z-scores for abdominal circumference (P\u2009=\u20090.003) and estimated fetal weight (P\u2009=\u20090.036) at 30\u2009+\u20090 to 32\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks, as well as higher sex- and gestational-age-specific Z-scores for birth weight (P\u2009=\u20090.019), neonatal head circumference (P\u2009=\u20090.011), neonatal chest circumference (P\u2009=\u20090.009) and neonatal skinfold thickness (subscapular, P\u2009=\u20090.004; triceps, P\u2009=\u20090.002), after adjusting for maternal prepregnancy body mass index, history of gestational diabetes mellitus and fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride levels. The adjusted odds ratio of high neonatal adiposity for the increasing vs decreasing AFI trajectory was 2.47 ((95%\u2009CI, 1.21-5.11); P\u2009=\u20090.014). An increasing AFI trajectory during pregnancy was associated with enhanced intrauterine fetal growth, higher birth weight and greater neonatal adiposity. This highlights the potential of AFI trajectory to serve as an indicator of fetal growth alongside fetal biometry. \u00a9 2025 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."

Clinical parameters-Random Blood Sugar (RBS), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)-were assessed at baseline and after four months of anti-TB therapy. The results showed no significant changes in mean RBS or CRP levels post-treatment, but a notable reduction in mean ESR was observed. Age and gender had minimal impact on therapeutic outcomes for RBS, CRP, or ESR, though females exhibited higher ESR values than males. Treatment regimens, whether Myrin P Forte alone or combined with streptomycin, did not significantly alter clinical parameters. However, CRP levels improved in TB patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, or gastroenteritis. A significant prevalence of diabetes (21.42%) was found among TB patients, with higher rates in females and those over 50\u00a0years. These findings highlight a notable association between diabetes and TB. However, the minimal effect of anti-TB therapy on clinical parameters suggests that ESR and CRP may not be reliable prognostic markers for TB. The study underscores the need for further large-scale case-control studies and molecular research to better understand the relationship between diabetes and TB, particularly given the high prevalence of diabetes among TB patients."

        "Abstract":"Hyperlipidemia, a prevalent comorbidity among type 2 diabetes patients, is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. It is unclear whether cocoa has beneficial impacts on the serum lipids of patients with diabetes. PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases were systematically reviewed for clinical trials on cocoa intake and blood lipids in type 2 diabetes until January 1, 2024, and the reference list of relevant articles was searched manually. Two reviewers extracted data and determined the risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane tool. The random effect model was applied to calculate standardized mean differences (SMDs). Finally, the certainty and clinical importance of the evidence were checked (PROSPERO registration code: CRD42021224931). Eleven RCTs with 506 participants were included. Different forms of cocoa and various intervention durations were applied. Only two RCTs had a low RoB. Findings showed a significant reduction in serum triglyceride (SMD: -\u20090.57, 95% CI -\u20091.05, -\u20090.10, I<sup>2<\/sup>: 82.7%), but not in other blood lipids. There was a severe\u200e heterogeneity in results justified with discrepancies in age, designs, durations, interventions, body mass index, baseline blood lipids, and risk of bias. The results showed low certainty and unimportant lipid changes. Although cocoa may slightly change serum lipids in diabetes, its recommendation for lipids control has fair clinical benefits. Due to the lack of certainty of findings and an inadequate number of studies, further well-designed trials considering possible sources of heterogeneity with low RoB are highly recommended."

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND Conventional clinical understanding holds that venous thrombus formation typically occurs days after traumatic injury. However, our findings demonstrate that acute thrombosis can begin within 7.5 hours after fracture in knee trauma cases, challenging existing paradigms. CASE REPORT A 43-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) after an electric bicycle accident precipitated by acute-onset dizziness accompanied by visual disturbances. Initial radiographic evaluation confirmed a comminuted right proximal tibia fracture with concomitant multiple acute ischemic cerebral infarctions on neuroimaging. Compression ultrasonography performed in the ED showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremities. However, markedly elevated D-dimer levels (9.39 mg\/L; reference <0.5 mg\/L) prompted high clinical suspicion for occult venous thromboembolism. Serial Doppler ultrasound surveillance revealed the rapid development of a free-floating thrombus in the right soleal vein within 7.5 hours after the fracture occurred. CONCLUSIONS This case report documents the exceptionally rapid development of venous thrombosis within 7.5 hours following a proximal tibia fracture, particularly in high-risk patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and ischemic stroke. These findings necessitate immediate reassessment of current thromboprophylaxis protocols in orthopedic trauma, emphasizing the critical importance of early and frequent vascular monitoring (including serial Doppler ultrasonography and D-dimer assessment) to detect hyperacute thrombus formation. Clinicians must maintain heightened awareness of this emergency thromboembolic risk while simultaneously managing hemorrhage concerns, as this case demonstrates that the traditional 24-hour prophylaxis window may be inadequate for certain high-risk trauma populations."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with an elevated risk of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) plays a key role in both T2D and ND pathogenesis by regulating neuroinflammation and neuronal survival. However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking T2D to NDs remain unclear. This study investigates how IGF1R-mediated immunomodulatory pathways could be leveraged for therapeutic purposes in T2D-related neurodegeneration. It further explores the combined effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and structured exercise on IGF1R signaling and their potential to mitigate T2D-induced neurodegenerative changes. Bioinformatics analyses and in vitro experiments were conducted using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and primary mouse cortical neurons exposed to amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) toxicity. IGF1R was overexpressed, and cells were treated with CS at varying concentrations. Cell viability, apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, and macrophage polarization were assessed using CCK-8, flow cytometry, ELISA, fluorescence microscopy, and related methods. Elevated IGF1R expression reduced A\u03b2-induced neuronal death and inflammation. CS administration increased IL-10 levels, suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and promoted M2-like macrophage polarization, enhancing neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-inflammatory responses. IGF1R is pivotal in regulating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis in T2D-associated neurodegeneration. Combined TCM and structured exercise may beneficially modulate IGF1R-dependent signaling and protect neurons. Further clinical studies are needed to validate these findings and assess their therapeutic potential."

This study investigated the association between diabetic avoidable hospitalization after the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and short- and long-term all-cause mortality. Participants were type 2 diabetes mellitus patients aged 60 years and older and gathered through the National Health Insurance Services Senior cohort data from 2008 to 2019. The outcome measures included five-year and overall period all-cause mortality. The main independent variable was the first-year experience of diabetic avoidable hospitalization after type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Regression analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. To enhance the robustness of the study results, a sensitivity analysis and inverse probability of treatment weighting method were conducted. Among 27 005 participants, 2099 (7.8%) died within five-year of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis and 4693 (17.4%) died in the overall study period after type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Participants who experienced diabetic avoidable hospitalization one year after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to those who did not (inverse probability of treatment weighted, Five-year: hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.36; Overall period: hazard ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.33-1.50).

        "Abstract":"People with dementia have higher mortality compared to individuals without dementia. Dementia itself and comorbidity, but also impaired function and self-care, probably all contribute to the high mortality. Dementia is characterized by a high degree of comorbidity and demand for self-care, and so are Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). All three diseases can severely impact functioning and quality of life. The aim of this study is to examine the excess mortality associated with DM and COPD in patients with dementia, compared with persons without these diseases, in Danish residents aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 years. The cohort included all individuals aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 years living in Denmark on January 1st, 2009, in total 874,426 individuals. All-cause mortality among persons with dementia, DM, and COPD was compared to persons free of these diseases. We estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR), with confidence intervals (CI), for all-cause mortality associated with the three diseases separately, and in combination, using Cox regression models. Finally, to understand the consequences when diseases coexist, an interaction effect on mortality was calculated for all combinations of diseases as the IRR for the combination divided by the product of the IRR of the individual diseases. The increase in all-cause mortality was IRR 2.86 (95% CI 2.83-2.89) for dementia, 1.45 (1.44-1.47) for DM, and 2.22 (2.20-2.24) for COPD. For the disease combinations mortality was IRR 3.93 (95% CI 3.83-4.04) for dementia and DM, 5.05 (95% CI 4.92-5.19) for dementia and COPD, and 3.34 (95% CI 3.26-3.41) for DM and COPD. Mortality for the combination of all three diagnoses was 5.66 (95% CI 5.36-5.98). The interaction effect on mortality was <\u20091, i.e. lower than expected from the total mortality related to the individual diseases, for all possible combinations of the three diseases, and lowest when dementia was involved in the combination. Dementia, DM, and COPD were independently, and in combination, associated with increased mortality. Contrastingly, coexistence seemed less deadly than the diseases on their own, possibly because they being discovered at an earlier stage, still, emphasizing the importance of focusing on shared health factors when treating patients with dementia."

        "Abstract":"The BRICS (Brazil, Russian, India, China and South Africa) was still in rapid development with great potential to promote the global governance of the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to offer practical experience and strategies for global T2DM management, particularly for developing countries by evaluating the trends, cross-country inequalities of T2DM burden in the BRICS in the past and further predict their changes to 2035. Age-standardized rate of incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of T2DM were calculated. Estimated annual percentage change, Joinpoint regression and age-period-cohort model were used to analyze trend, decomposition analysis were used to attribute changes in total DALYs to population aging, population growth, and DALYs change, and Bayesian age-period-cohort model was used to predict. The cases number and ASR of T2DM incidence, prevalence and DALYs in the BRICS increased from 1990 to 2021, with obvious growth in Russia and South Africa. The highest incident relative risk (RR) in Brazil and China peaked at 55-59 years old with a notable RR in Chinese youths aged 20-24 years old, whereas it peaked at 60-64 years old in Russia, India and South Africa. The higher prevalent RR was after 65 years in the BRICS. The incident and prevalent RRs in the BRICS increased over time except for China where the incident RR decreased since 1995. Individuals born earlier had higher incident and prevalent RRs in Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa while individuals born later had higher incident RRs in China. Males bore a heavier burden of T2DM in India and China while females bore heavier in Brazil, Russia and South Africa. The impacts of population aging, population growth and epidemiological changes in China, Brazil, and Russia were the greatest respectively. The DALYs difference per 100,000 between countries with the lowest and highest SDI was 429.89 (95%CI: 187.62 to 672.17) in 1990, rising to 711.63 (95%CI: 416.73 to 1006.53) in 2021. The health inequality concentration index was -\u20099.60 (95%CI: -10.00 to -9.20) in 1990 and -\u200912.91 (95%CI: -13.71 to -12.10) in 2021. Until 2035, the incidence, prevalence and DALYs were projected to increase overall in the BRICS. Developing comprehensive T2DM guidelines should be a key BRICS cooperation priority, leveraging proven aging population and chronic disease management experiences. Russia, India, and South Africa should prioritize older adults, whereas China and Brazil need to focus on middle-aged and older adults, with China additionally addressing younger-onset T2DM trends. Insulin shortages and severe infectious diseases pose major challenges, particularly in less developed countries, necessitating the expansion of early intervention programs, educational initiatives, and integrated hospital care to enhance T2DM control."

Qualitative responses were analyzed using Rapid Qualitative Analysis and organized by race\/ethnicity. While 84% expressed willingness to join a trial, most had never been asked. NH participants prioritized helping their community and accessing new treatments. PI participants emphasized helping their doctor and advancing science. Filipino participants valued new treatments and contributing to science. White participants ranked financial incentives and community benefit. Major barriers included concerns about unknown medication risks, lack of understanding, and mistrust-particularly among PI and Filipino participants. Many NH and PI participants noted that helping family members was a key motivator. Across all groups, preferred communication strategies included physician referrals, text messaging, and physical mail. Tailored recruitment strategies emphasizing family and community benefits, involvement of trusted local providers, and culturally relevant communication may enhance clinical trial participation among underrepresented populations with type 2 diabetes."

        "Title":"Diabetes and Cardiometabolic Care, Pharmacotherapy, and Patient Outcomes in Two Regional Aboriginal Primary Care Health Centres: Lessons to be Learnt.",
        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects Aboriginal Australian populations six times more frequently than non-Indigenous Australians, with disparity increasing by remoteness. Contemporary guidelines recommend optimising cardiometabolic care, including achieving a target glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <7%, blood pressure <130\/80 mmHg, and use of pharmacotherapy, including the maximal tolerated statin dose and consideration of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in selected subpopulations. This study aimed to determine whether cardiometabolic treatment targets and pharmacological management met best practice guidelines in two rural Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. A retrospective audit of electronic medical records was conducted in two rural Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations between January 2020 and January 2021. Data were collected for people aged over 18 years who regularly attended the clinic, identified as Aboriginal, and had a documented diagnosis of T2DM. A total of 274 patients met the inclusion criteria, 64% of whom were female. The median age of T2DM diagnosis was 44 years (interquartile range 32-50), with a median diabetes duration of 9 years (3-17), HbA1c 8.0% (6.9-9.4), body mass index 31.6 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (27-36.3), urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) 3.8 mg\/mol (1.1-20.0), and mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol 2.1 mmol\/L (\u00b10.8). Capture rates were 70% for HbA1c, 51% for urine ACR, and 51% for lipid studies. Among recorded results, 51\/193 (26%) of HbA1c were <7%, 80\/228 (35%) of blood pressure readings were below 130\/80 mmHg. Nephropathy was present in 42% of patients, and obesity in 61%. Clinically significant albuminuria was observed in 69\/140 (50%) of patients with available ACR data. Statins were prescribed in 50%, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in 20%, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in 7% of the population. This study has characterised a population with an early age of T2DM diagnosis, high rates of nephropathy and obesity, and suboptimal glycaemic control. Prescription rates of modern therapies were low. These findings highlight areas for targeted improvement in the quality of cardiometabolic care, including the increased use of modern diabetes agents."

        "Abstract":"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally and is particularly high among hospitalized patients, presenting challenges for inpatient care. While traditional inpatient management emphasizes glycemic control, medication adjustments, and comorbidity management, malnutrition and muscle loss remain underrecognized factors that significantly influence clinical outcomes. This review aims to highlight the role of malnutrition and muscle dysfunction in hospitalized patients with diabetes and to evaluate the potential of medical nutrition therapy (MNT), particularly diabetes-specific nutrition formulas (DSNFs), to improve patient outcomes. This narrative review is based on the proceedings of a joint session between the Diabetes Nutrition Study Group (DNSG) and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN). Relevant literature was synthesized to explore the prevalence, pathophysiology, and clinical impact of malnutrition and muscle loss in diabetes, as well as the clinical applications of MNT and DSNFs in hospital and intensive care settings. Malnutrition is prevalent among hospitalized patients with diabetes yet frequently goes undiagnosed, contributing to delayed recovery, increased complications, and functional decline. Muscle mass and function are now recognized as key determinants of metabolic regulation and recovery. Recent advances in diagnostic frameworks, including those developed by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), offer practical tools for the early identification of malnutrition and sarcopenia. Evidence supports the use of MNT, particularly DSNFs, as a strategy to support glycemic control, preserve muscle mass, and reduce complications in both general hospital and ICU settings. Malnutrition and muscle dysfunction are important but often overlooked components of inpatient diabetes care. Early identification using validated screening tools, coupled with timely implementation of MNT, including DSNFs, offers a promising strategy to improve metabolic management and clinical outcomes in hospitalized and critically ill patients with diabetes."

        "Abstract":"Cytosolic pH (pHc) is one of the most essential intracellular microenvironments profoundly affecting charges, conformations and therefore functions of macromolecules. It remains challenging to quantitatively measure pHc at single cell resolution in vivo and how pHc of a specific cell type dynamically responds to physiological or pathophysiological fluctuations remains elusive. Smad5 is a pHc sensor with accelerated nuclear export upon pHc alkalization and ideally the nucleocytoplasmic ratio of Smad5 would be a potential indicator of pHc. Here, we revealed that the constitutive eGFP-Smad5 expression transgenic mice could serve as pHc reporter for quantitative detection of cellular pHc in vivo. We mapped pHc of major cell types in the reporter mice and found robust pHc heterogeneity in individual cell types or different cell types adjacently located within a tissue. By acute systemic acidification or alkalization challenges, we also characterized pHc-stable and pHc-sensitive cell types. In pathological microenvironments related to type 2 diabetes mellitus or tumors, pHc showed responsive or adaptive changes in some specific cell types, highlighting pathophysiological roles of pHc in disease onset and progression or plasticity of cells under chronic disease states. Our study establishes a previously unachievable method for mapping of cellular pHc in vivo under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions."

        "Abstract":"Glibenclamide (Gli), a second-generation sulfonylurea, has been widely used for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its potent glucose-lowering effect and affordability. Recently, renewed scientific interest has emerged due to its potential anti-aging effects, mediated through mitochondrial function modulation and epigenetic regulation. Despite its longstanding clinical use, Gli's comprehensive real-world safety profile remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to systematically evaluate adverse event (AE) signals associated with Gli based on data from the U.S. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between Q1 2004 and Q4 2023. We performed a disproportionality analysis using four established signal detection algorithms: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS). AEs were analyzed at both the system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) levels, with additional sex-stratified assessments. A total of 1,758 Gli-related reports were included. The strongest signal was identified in \"metabolism and nutrition disorders\" (ROR = 8.07; IC025 = 2.8), with hypoglycemia and its neurological sequelae being particularly prominent. Other elevated signals were noted for hepatobiliary, renal, and cardiac disorders. Sex-specific analysis revealed a stronger hepatic and metabolic signal in males, while some neurological and cardiovascular PTs were more prominent in females. Unexpected signals such as counterfeit product exposure and abnormal insulin C-peptide levels also emerged. Our findings highlight Gli's multifaceted safety concerns, reinforcing known risks while identifying novel AE signals. This evidence supports the need for continued pharmacovigilance and individualized risk assessment in Gli prescribing."

        "Abstract":"Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is considered a risk factor for gastric dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. While surveillance endoscopies are often performed, particularly for incomplete GIM, the clinical value of histologic subtyping (complete, incomplete, or mixed) remains unclear. This study evaluated the progression risk of different GIM subtypes diagnosed through random gastric biopsies and their association with various clinical factors. Archived pathology data from 206 gastric biopsy cases were analyzed, including 52 negative controls, 56 complete GIM, 54 incomplete GIM, and 44 mixed GIM. Histologic slides were reviewed for subtype confirmation and other pathological changes; clinical data were extracted from medical records. Multiple linear regression was conducted for correlation analysis, and Analysis of Variance was used to compare group means. GIM was predominantly located in the antrum. Over a mean follow-up period of 52.2 months, none of the patients, including 12 under mapping surveillance, developed gastric neoplasia. Significant associations were found between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and all types of GIM. H. pylori infection was also significantly associated with the extent of the GIM. Hypertension showed a trend toward significance in correlation with GIM, but no other associations were identified between GIM and demographic or clinical factors such as gender, age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. Our findings suggest that the routine subtyping GIM in pathology reports may not be necessary, given the lack of progression to any type of neoplasia within the follow-up period. However, the redemonstrated association between H. pylori and GIM emphasizes the importance of eradication therapy."

        "Abstract":"Evidence suggests that community pharmacist-led interventions in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can improve clinical outcomes such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and lipid profiles, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications. However, limited research has evaluated the economic value of such interventions, particularly in the context of Iran. Given the absence of well-designed studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of community pharmacist-based interventions in preventing cardiovascular complications among patients with T2DM in Iran, this study aimed to evaluate the economic and clinical impact of such an intervention. Standard care provided by community pharmacists served as the comparator. This study was conducted over 12 months in a community pharmacy setting. A total of 110 patients with T2DM were enrolled, with 55 receiving usual care (comparator group) and 55 receiving a structured pharmacist-led intervention. The intervention included medication optimization, lifestyle counseling, and dietary guidance, with a focus on reducing cardiovascular risk. Economic evaluation was performed from the healthcare system perspective using a Markov model over a 10-year time horizon. Outcomes included life years gained (LYG) and reduction in the 10-year risk of cardiovascular events. Direct medical costs for both the intervention and comparator groups were considered. Pharmacist-led interventions significantly reduced average HbA1c levels (p\u2009=\u20090.009), improved HDL cholesterol (p\u2009=\u20090.016), and lowered LDL cholesterol (p\u2009=\u20090.05) in the intervention group compared to the comparator. SBP also showed a statistically significant improvement in the intervention group (p\u2009=\u20090.003), while the comparator group experienced an increase in SBP. The estimated 10-year risks for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, both fatal and nonfatal, were lower in the intervention group. The cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that the intervention resulted in a cost saving of -1469.02 USD and an additional 0.045 life years gained compared to usual care. The findings suggest that community pharmacist-led interventions targeting cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with T2DM are both clinically effective and cost-efficient. Incorporating pharmacists into diabetes care programs may significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes while reducing long-term healthcare costs in Iran."

        "Abstract":"Each year, over 700,000 pregnancies occur in the UK, with up to 10% affected by complications such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus. Pregnancy-related complications and reproductive factors are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. Our aim was to determine whether adding pregnancy factors to a prediction model with established CVD risk factors improves 10-year risk prediction of CVD in postpartum women, using QRISK\u00ae-3 as a benchmark model. We used a population-based retrospective cohort of women aged 15 to 49 who had been pregnant from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care database. Women who were CVD-free were followed from 6\u00a0months postpartum. We evaluated the performance of QRISK\u00ae-3 and updated the risk prediction model using established risk factors for CVD from QRISK\u00ae-3 and additional risk factors specific to pregnancy. Models were developed using Cox-proportional hazards regression for CVD within 10\u00a0years. Models were evaluated and compared using measures of overall model fit, calibration, discrimination and clinical utility. Among 567,667 eligible women, 2175 (0.38%) experienced a CVD event within 10\u00a0years. The median follow-up was 4\u00a0years. Of the additional pregnancy factors, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, miscarriage, stillbirth, postnatal depression, gravidity, endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome remained associated with CVD after adjusting for other established risk factors of CVD. Adding pregnancy factors to those from QRISK\u00ae-3 led to marginal improvements in model performance (QRISK\u00ae-3 C-statistic: 0.703 (95% CI 0.687 to 0.718), updated model C-statistic: 0.726 (95% CI 0.711 to 0.740) Although calibration did not improve overall, subgroup analysis showed better calibration in women with a history of pre-eclampsia, postnatal depression and preterm birth using the updated model. The clinical utility was improved for updated models. The updated risk prediction models resulted in marginal improvement in discrimination and calibration compared to QRISK\u00ae-3 in postpartum women. This could be due to the known association of pregnancy-related complications with established risk factors of CVD. Although the overall predictive performance and calibration of the updated models was similar, the updated model resulted in better clinical utility."

This four-year prospective cohort study was conducted in Saudi Arabia, enrolling adults with confirmed acute COVID-19 from multiple affiliated healthcare centers between March 2020 and March 2024. Of 1,521 screened patients, 816 were enrolled and followed for up to four years (median: 24 months). Per WHO criteria, participants were classified as having long COVID-19 (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u2009238) or resolved infection (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u2009578). Demographics, comorbidities, vaccination, reinfection, and acute illness severity were recorded. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using SF-36 and EQ-5D-5\u00a0L. Logistic regression identified predictors of long COVID-19, and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated time to recovery. Fatigue (57.1%), post-exertional malaise (45.8%), cough (41.2%), and cognitive dysfunction (30.7%) were the most common persistent symptoms. Female sex (adjusted OR 11.11; 95% CI: 4.48\u201326.24) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR 14.3; 95% CI: 7.0\u201329.4) independently predicted long COVID-19. Delayed recovery was associated with female sex (aHR 3.36; 95% CI: 1.85\u20136.10), diabetes (aHR 1.57; 95% CI: 1.00\u20132.46), reinfection (aHR 1.86; 95% CI: 1.05\u20133.29), and hospitalization (aHR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.16). HRQoL scores remained significantly lower at 6 and 12 months. In the long COVID-19 group, 38.7% of patients normally resumed work within 12 months, compared to 82.3% in the resolved COVID-19 group. Nearly 29% of post-acute COVID-19 patients developed long COVID-19 in this Middle Eastern cohort. Female sex, diabetes, reinfection, and hospitalization predicted delayed recovery. Persistent symptoms and impaired HRQoL highlight the need for early risk stratification and structured post-COVID care.

Here, we investigated 6432 plasma proteins (1533 previously unstudied in large-scale proteomic GWAS) using the SomaLogic (v4.1) aptamer-based technology in a Scottish population from the Viking Genes study. A total of 505 significant independent protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) were found for 455 proteins in blood plasma: 382 cis- (P\u2009<\u20095\u00d710<sup>-8<\/sup>) and 123 trans- (P\u2009<\u20096.6\u00d710<sup>-12<\/sup>). Of these, 31 cis-pQTL were for proteins with no previous GWAS. We leveraged these pQTL to perform causal inference using bidirectional Mendelian randomisation and colocalisation against complex traits of biomedical importance. We discovered 43 colocalising associations (with a posterior probability\u2009>\u200980% that pQTL and complex traits share a causal variant), pointing to plausible causal roles for the proteins. These findings include hitherto undiscovered causal links of leukocyte receptor tyrosine kinase (LTK) to type-2 diabetes and beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase (B3GAT1) to prostate cancer. These new connections will help guide the search for new or repurposed therapies. Our findings provide strong support for continuing to increase the number of proteins studied using GWAS."

        "Abstract":"Obesity is a key risk factor for arterial stiffness (AS) and a strong predictor of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the risk of AS is further exacerbated due to metabolic dysregulation and chronic inflammation, especially when both conditions coexist. Traditional obesity indices such as Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC) have limitations in assessing fat distribution and metabolic risk. New indices like Weight-adjusted Waist Index (WWI), A Body Shape Index (ABSI), and Body Roundness Index (BRI) have been proposed as supplementary or alternative measures. However, the association between WWI and AS in patients with T2DM has not been sufficiently studied. This study aims to evaluate the association between WWI and AS in T2DM patients and compare the diagnostic performance of WWI with traditional obesity indices (BMI, WC) and other new indices (ABSI, BRI) in predicting AS. 1406 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included in this cross-sectional study. Obesity indices were calculated using anthropometric parameters. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BaPWV) was measured to determine AS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between the five obesity indices and AS. Smoothed curve fitting was used to test the linear correlations. The diagnostic accuracy of each obesity index was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Additional subgroup analyses and tests for interaction were conducted. The average BaPWV was 1611.98 (318.81) cm\/s. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated a strong correlation between WWI and AS, with each standard deviation increase in WWI resulting in a 48.59\u00a0cm\/s rise in BaPWV (95% CI 31.66-65.52) and a 44% higher risk of AS (OR\u2009=\u20091.44, 95% CI 1.21-1.70). ROC analysis indicated that WWI identified AS more accurately than the other obesity indices, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.659. The AUC for WC, BMI, ABSI, and BRI were 0.538, 0.519, 0.626, and 0.599, respectively. Further examination of subgroups showed that the correlation between WWI and AS remained consistent and positive. The results of this study show that there is a significant positive correlation between WWI and BaPWV in patients with T2DM. Additionally, compared to other obesity indices, WWI is associated with a higher risk of AS. It may be a potentially simple and effective tool for assessing AS in clinical practice."

Yet, the impact of GLP-1RAs on coronary lesion progression and cardiovascular outcomes after coronary stent implantation remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of GLP-1RAs on coronary lesion progression and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This prospective cohort study enrolled 1664 patients with T2D who underwent PCI from January 2020 to March 2024. Matched GLP-1RAs-treated and non-treated cohorts were formed using the propensity score matching method. The primary endpoint was the incidence of MACEs (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure). Secondary endpoints included in-stent restenosis and non-target lesion progression. Two 131-patient cohorts with balanced baseline characteristics were formed by propensity score matching. During the median follow-up period of 20\u00a0months (ranging from 6 to 48\u00a0months), the incidence of MACEs was significantly lower in the GLP-1RA group (7.63%)compared to the control group (19.85%) (HR 0.444; 95%CI, 0.215-0.918; P\u2009=\u20090.024). During a median follow-up period of 12\u00a0months, 79.39% (104\/131) of patients in the control group and 82.44% (108\/131) of patients in the GLP-1RA group successfully underwent coronary angiography follow-up. The incidence of in-stent restenosis was 2.78% (3\/108) in the GLP-1RA group and 11.54% (12\/104) in the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.028). Non-target lesion progression was found in 10.19% (11\/108) patient of the GLP-1RA group and 22.12% (23\/104) in the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.037). Notable disparities were observed between the two groups regarding improvements of BMI, SBP, HbA1c, LDL-C, CRP. GLP-1RAs significantly reduced the incidence of MACEs and coronary lesion progression in patients with T2D after coronary stent implantation. These findings suggest that GLP-1RAs may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes and coronary artery disease progression in this population."

A total of 1608 eligible participants were enrolled in the study. The HbA1c\/HDL-C ratio was calculated by dividing HbA1c by HDL-C. LASSO regression, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed to examine the relationship between the HbA1c\/HDL-C ratio and CAC. The nomogram incorporating the HbA1c\/HDL-C ratio was further established by multivariate logistic regression and evaluated. The HbA1c\/HDL-C ratios in the CAC group were significantly higher than the control group [4.73 (4.01, 5.56) vs. 4.34 (3.67, 5.05), p\u2009<\u20090.001].

Furthermore, an elevated HbA1c\/HDL-C ratio was an independent effect factor for CAC [odds ratio, 1.135; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.008-1.279; p\u2009=\u20090.037]. The area under the ROC curve of the HbA1c\/HDL-C ratio was 0.630 (95% CI 0.596-0.663), and the model incorporating age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and the HbA1c\/HDL-C ratio was 0.718 (95% CI 0.686-0.751). The constructed nomogram based on this model demonstrated favorable discrimination and clinical utility.

We categorized DR as follows: mild, moderate, severe non-proliferative (NPDR), and proliferative DR (PDR). Additional category of vision-threatening DR (VTDR) included severe NPDR or more, or moderate NPDR with clinically significant macular edema. Blindness was defined as visual acuity \u22643\/60. At least 1-step progression was categorized as DR progressing. Cox-proportional hazard model was used. The incidence and progression of DR were 34.6 and 35.1, and incidence of VTDR and blindness were 24.5 and 8.33\/1000 person-years, respectively. Longer diabetes duration was associated with increasing the risk of developing DR (Hazard ratio 1.37 [95% confidence interval 1.10-1.72]) and VTDR (2.00 [1.60-2.50]) and progressing DR (1.50 [1.23-1.84]) in 5 years.

        "Abstract":"Although gut microbiota and lipid metabolites have been suggested to be closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the interactions between gut microbiota, lipid metabolites, and the host in T2DM development remains unclear. Rhesus macaques may be the best animal model to investigate these relationships given their spontaneous development of T2DM. We identified eight spontaneous T2DM macaques and conducted a comprehensive study investigating the relationships using multi-omics sequencing technology. Our results from 16 S rRNA, metagenome, metabolome, and transcriptome analyses identified that gut microbiota imbalance, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation disorders, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation, and inflammation occurred in T2DM macaques. We verified the accumulation of palmitic acid (PA) and activation of inflammation in T2DM macaques. Importantly, mice transplanted with spontaneous T2DM macaque fecal microbiota and fed a high PA diet developed prediabetes within 120 days. We determined that gut microbiota mediated the absorption of excess PA in the ileum, resulting in the accumulation of PA in the serum, consequently leading to T2DM in mice. In particular, we demonstrated that the specific microbiota composition was probably involved in the process. This study provides new insight into interactions between microbiota and metabolites and confirms causative effect of gut microbiota on T2DM development."

Enrichment analysis revealed that the primary pathways involving these targets including prolactin signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, TNF signaling pathway, relaxin signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Molecular docking demonstrated that mandenol exhibited a strong binding affinity toward EGFR domain, and wallichilide displayed pronounced binding affinity toward AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, and PTGS2 domains. Additionally, myricanone and senkyunone also showed strong binding affinity for AKT1, EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, and PTGS2 domains. This study revealed the potential multi-component and multi-target mechanisms of <i>Rhizoma Chuanxiong<\/i> in treating DKD through network pharmacology. Supplementary experiments are required to further verify these findings."

A total of 151,301 pregnancies in China from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021 were included, and 8,222 subjects matched their primary and second pregnancy information. Join point regression was used to analyze the temporal trends of adverse outcomes with maternal age and birth spacing. The mean maternal age at delivery rose from 27.1 years to 28.5 between 2010 and 2021, and the average annual percentage change in advanced maternal age (\u2265\u200935 years) was 1.2%. The optimal childbearing age (with the fewest adverse outcomes) appears to be 27 years. Compared with women aged 27 years, both those aged\u2009<\u200927 years and those aged\u2009>\u200927 years exhibited a significantly higher risk of anemia, low birth weight (LBW), preeclampsia, and preterm birth. In addition, we found that the optimal primiparous childbearing age was 26 years old and birth spacing was 3 years, <\u20093 years increased the risk of FGR, oligohydramnios, placenta previa, preeclampsia, LBW, preterm birth and premature rupture of membranes (PROM). While birth spacing\u2009>\u20093 years significantly increased the risks of anemia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), placenta previa, preeclampsia, thyroid dysfunction (TD), preterm birth and PROM. The subgroup analysis revealed that the common adverse outcomes increased with longer birth spacing in pregnant women\u2009<\u200926 years, while these adverse outcomes showed lowest prevalence rates at 3-year birth spacing in pregnant women\u2009>\u200926 years. The age of childbearing continues to be delayed, and we are in favor of having children at relatively optimal ages and spacing."

        "Abstract":"Self-efficacy emerges as a crucial element that impacts engagement in self-care behaviors among patients with type 2 diabetes. There is a lack of studies examining management self-efficacy and quality of life among patients with type 2 diabetes in Palestine. Thus, this study examined these variables among this cohort. A cross-sectional study and a convenience sample of 397 patients with type 2 diabetes who attended diabetic clinics in the North West Bank, Palestine, were recruited. Data were collected using a paper self-reported questionnaire composed of the RVDQOL-13 scale to assess the quality of life and the diabetes management self-efficacy scale. The participants received the questionnaire in person during their scheduled clinic visits and completed it independently. The researchers were responsible for distributing the questionnaires to participants and collecting them on the same day during the period from June to September 2023. The participants reported a high diabetes management self-efficacy, with a mean score of 73.6 (\u00b1\u200914.5), while their quality of life was generally poor, with a mean score of 47.6 (\u00b1\u200913.1). Quality of life showed significant positive associations with employment (p.b.r\u2009=\u20090.143, p\u2009<\u20090.01), monthly income (p.b.r\u2009=\u20090.137, p\u2009<\u20090.01), educational level (p.b.r\u2009=\u20090.137, p\u2009<\u20090.01), male gender (p.b.r\u2009=\u20090.120, p\u2009<\u20090.05), diabetes management self-efficacy (r\u2009=\u20090.545, p\u2009<\u20090.01), and duration of diabetes (r\u2009=\u20090.157, p\u2009<\u20090.01). In contrast, quality of life was negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) (p.b.r = -0.100, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and HbA1c levels (r = -0.265, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Multiple regression analysis identified diabetes management self-efficacy (b\u2009=\u20090.474, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer duration of diabetes (b\u2009=\u20090.204, p\u2009<\u20090.015) as significant positive predictors of quality of life. Conversely, higher HbA1c levels were found to be a significant negative predictor of quality of life (b= -1.278, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This study emphasizes the need for multi-dimensional, person-centered care for patients with type 2 diabetes.

        "Abstract":"Cerebral infarction, a cerebrovascular disorder, is characterized by the sudden onset of neurological deficits and clinical symptoms. It ranks among the leading causes of death and severe disability worldwide. The etiology of cerebral infarction is multifaceted, with common risk factors including dietary patterns, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. In recent years, the role of the gut microbiota in systemic immunity and tumorigenesis has been intensively explored, thrusting the research on the gut-brain axis into the spotlight. However, there is a lack of literature investigating the relationship between the gut microbiota and blood metabolites in cerebral infarction. In this study, we employed 16S rRNA analysis and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS\/MS) for a comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of fecal samples from cerebral infarction patients and the general population. Our results revealed a significant correlation between the gut microbiome and serum metabolites, highlighting the impact of the microbiome on metabolic pathways. Specifically, we found that 35 gut microbiome taxa, such as Actinobacteriota and Peptostreptococcales-Tissierellales, were significantly enriched in the control group (N group). Through Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis, 72 taxa showed significant differences between cerebral infarction patients and healthy individuals. Among them, 22 key taxa were identified as microbial biomarkers for differentiating patients from healthy controls. These findings suggest that variations in the microbiome and metabolites could potentially serve as biomarkers for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cerebral infarction."

Breastfeeding may improve immediate cardiometabolic health in these patients; however, women with pregnancy complications are less likely to initiate breastfeeding and more likely to cease breastfeeding early. It is still not known if women understand that breastfeeding can improve cardiovascular disease risk following a pregnancy complication, and if this knowledge would influence breastfeeding outcomes. To assess women's awareness of breastfeeding and cardiovascular disease risk reduction following a pregnancy complication. Qualitative, descriptive study. Women with previous complications of pregnancy completed self-administered questionnaires and attended focus group style or one-to-one interviews at a tertiary hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. The following themes were discussed: experience with breastfeeding following a complication of pregnancy, knowledge on the benefit of breastfeeding for reducing heart disease, support for women to breastfeed for 6\u2009months postpartum and integrated support during postpartum cardiovascular risk counselling. Interviews were transcribed, and deductive thematic analysis was undertaken with NVIVO V12. Eight women attended interview sessions, with all women being aware that breastfeeding improves heart disease risk factors. However, only 75% of women knew that breastfeeding was particularly beneficial for women with a previous complication of pregnancy. Women reported attachment and guilt as major barriers to breastfeeding, and that breastfeeding support could be improved with individualised counselling prior to discharge, more frequent postpartum visits and explaining that breastfeeding can reduce cardiometabolic disease. These patient-reported barriers and areas of improvement are important to consider when tailoring lactation counselling support for women with previous complications of pregnancy."

A population-based, parallel-randomized controlled trial of Danish men aged 60-64 years randomized 1:4 to invitation to screening for subclinical CVD or no invitation (control group) were performed. Allocation was based on computer-generated random numbers and stratified on municipality. Only the control group was blinded. The screening included coronary artery calcification score, aneurysms, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Intervention included statin, aspirin and surveillance. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. 31,268 participants were randomized; 25,322 men in the control arm and 5,946 in the invited arm, of whom 3,720 attended and were screened (62\u00b76%). In intention-to-treat analyses, after a median follow-up of 7\u00b70 years, 555 (9.3%) men in the intervention group and 2,509 (9\u00b79%) men in the control group had died; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.94 (95% CI: 0\u00b786;1\u00b703), p=0\u00b7169.Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were registered in 606 (10\u00b72%) versus 2,682 (10\u00b76%) (HR=0\u00b796 [95% CI 0\u00b788;1.04]; p=0\u00b7319).Severe bleedings were significantly more common in the invited-to-screening group (6\u00b70% versus 5\u00b71%; HR=1\u00b718 [95% CI 1\u00b705;1\u00b732]; p=0\u00b7007).

Identifying risk factors and biomarkers associated with PCS can facilitate early diagnosis and improve patient management. This study aimed to assess the prevalence, diagnostic markers and clinical characteristics of post-COVID syndrome (PCS) in the Abay region. A retrospective-prospective cohort study was conducted among 639 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Participants were divided into two groups: those with PCS (n=300) and those without (n=339). Clinical and demographic data, laboratory biomarkers, and vaccination history were analyzed. Statistical analyses, including logistic regression, were applied to identify key risk factors and clinical subtypes of PCS. The prevalence of PCS was 47%, with significant differences observed between groups regarding comorbid conditions, and laboratory biomarkers. PCS patients had a higher incidence of hypertension (47% vs. 23.5%, p=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (10.3% vs. 6.7%, p=0.032). Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were associated with PCS (p=0.004), whereas hematocrit (HCT) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were lower in PCS patients. Cluster analysis identified four distinct clinical phenotypes, emphasizing the heterogeneity of PCS manifestations. Vaccination status showed a significant inverse correlation with PCS incidence (p=0.002), suggesting a protective effect of higher vaccine doses. PCS presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach for optimal patient management. Identified biomarkers, including ALP, HCT, and IgG, may serve as potential indicators for PCS diagnosis. Vaccination ap-pears to reduce PCS risk, highlighting the importance of immunization in mitigating long-term COVID-19 complications. These findings contribute to a better understanding of PCS pathophysiology and provide a foundation for future research and personalized treatment strategies."

Proportion of patients with severe liver steatosis (S3) was lowest in the group 1 (61.9%), while no difference was found between groups 2 and 3 (74.3% vs 76.7%; <i>p<\/i> = 0.5). Moderate-to-severe liver fibrosis (stages F2-F4) was less widespread in the group 1 (24.1%); significant difference by this parameter was also revealed between groups 2 and 3 (34.0% vs 45.4%; <i>p<\/i> = 0.004). Proportion of patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis was similar in groups 2 and 3 (33.9% vs 35.4%; <i>p<\/i> = 0.7), but was lower in the group 1 (26.7% vs 33.9% and 35.4%; <i>p<\/i> = 0.02 and <i>p<\/i> < 0.001, respectively). Carbohydrate metabolism disorders are closely associated with progressive steatosis and liver fibrosis in patients with MASLD. No differences in the severity of liver steatosis was found between groups with prediabetes and T2DM, however, in T2DM, the prevalence of advanced\/severe liver fibrosis was highest among all studied groups."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterised by elevated blood glucose levels, leading to widespread systemic and localised complications, including weakened wound healing. Diabetic wounds, particularly diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), are related to delayed healing, chronic inflammation, and increased risk of amputation. Key pathological factors include hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, neuropathy, immune dysfunction, and impaired angiogenesis. Among various therapeutic approaches, topical insulin has emerged as a promising strategy to accelerate wound repair in diabetic patients. Insulin's ability to regulate glucose metabolism, promote angiogenesis, and stimulate cellular repair mechanisms underscores its potential role in tissue regeneration. Recent advances in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) have further improved the targeted delivery and sustained insulin release at wound sites. These nanotherapeutics enhance drug efficacy, cell specificity, and controlled release, fostering rapid and efficient tissue repair. Future research focusing on optimised formulations, personalised treatment approaches, and clinical validation could revolutionise the management of diabetic wounds, improve patient outcomes, and reduce complications associated with chronic diabetes."

        "Title":"Impact of a real-time prescription benefit on adherence and utilization of low-cost prescription alternatives for members new to diabetes treatment.",
        "Abstract":"Chronic diseases such as diabetes are a major burden to the US health care system. High medication adherence helps improve diabetes outcomes and reduce cost. Cost of medications can contribute to nonadherence. Use of a formulary decision support system with e-prescribing may be associated with greater use of generic medications, leading to lower costs and better adherence. A real-time prescription benefit (RTPB) solution provides patient-specific drug pricing, benefit information, and therapeutic options to choose the most cost-effective and clinically appropriate treatment. To examine whether RTPB is associated with increased adherence measured by proportion of days covered, higher utilization of generics, and generic dispensing rate? Is RTPB associated with lower plan and patient out-of-pocket (OOP) per-user per-month costs? This study used a retrospective, matched intervention-control analysis of commercial health plan members from a large pharmacy benefits manager. Members were eligible for inclusion if they initiated therapy between January and August 2021. Members were excluded if they were not continuously eligible for coverage over the study period. Members who initiated diabetes therapy with a prescriber using RTPB (intervention) were compared with those new to therapy with a prescriber not using RTPB (control). Index date for both samples was the first medication prescription in the index period. Members were matched on age and sex demographics. The evaluation period lasted 12 months after index date. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the impact of an RTPB program on adherence and proportion of prescriptions filled with a generic. A generalized linear model (gamma distribution, log link) estimated plan and OOP patient costs, whereas a generalized linear model model with the Poisson distribution was used to estimate the number of controlling for patient age, sex, social determinants of health score, and other patient- and plan-level covariates. 1,302 matched pairs were included in the analysis. Findings show the proportion of days covered was 68.7% for control and 71.4% for RTPB members (<i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The average number of generic prescriptions for control and RTPB samples were 4.06 and 5.66, respectively (<i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05) and the generic dispensing rates were 44.9% and 60.1%, respectively (<i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The mean plan cost per member per month for diabetes medications, for the non-RTPB group, was 32.3% higher than the RTPB sample (a difference of $81.69, <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) and the mean patient cost per month was 88.8% higher than the RTPB sample (a difference of $9.71, <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.0001). Access to RTPB tools provides prescribers with formulary benefit and therapeutic options that allow them to provide the lowest-cost clinical treatment, thus improving adherence, increasing use of generic medications, and lowering plan and patient OOP costs."

        "Abstract":"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, a subtype of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), uncommonly causes pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusions occur in 10% to 12% of lung cancer cases but are rarely the initial presentation. We report a case of a 68-year-old male with type II diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented with right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, and anorexia, suspicious of hepatobiliary disease. Imaging incidentally revealed a large pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. Cytology of pericardial fluid identified malignancy, and biopsy of a mass found on subsequent chest computerized tomography diagnosed SCC of the lung. The patient experienced respiratory failure accompanied by bilateral pneumothorax, leading to the decision to initiate hospice care. Pericardial effusion warrants prompt echocardiography and pericardiocentesis with cytology. NSCLC-related effusions signify stage IV disease, managed palliatively with immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This case emphasizes the critical importance of evaluating pericardial effusions for malignancy, even in instances where the presentation may be atypical. We present a case of malignant cardiac tamponade that was obscured by underlying hepatobiliary disease. Maintaining a high level of suspicion for malignant effusions is essential, as failure to do so may lead to increased morbidity in patients with undiagnosed malignancies."

        "Title":"Transient Renal Artery Stenosis in Renal Infarction: A Case Report.",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND Renal infarction is a rare condition resulting from interruption of renal arterial blood flow. Its nonspecific presentation often mimics more common diagnoses such as nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, or musculoskeletal pain, contributing to delayed or missed diagnosis. Early identification is essential to prevent irreversible renal damage and optimize patient outcomes. Imaging plays a critical role in both the initial diagnosis and in determining the underlying etiology, which may include thromboembolism, in-situ thrombosis, vascular injury, or hypercoagulable states. CASE REPORT We describe a case of a 63-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hormone replacement therapy, and a 42 pack-year smoking history, who presented with sudden-onset, severe left-flank pain. Initial laboratory results were nonspecific, with mild proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Computed tomography (CT) angiography demonstrated severe stenosis of the superior left renal artery and extensive left renal infarction. A diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal infarction was made. She was treated with intravenous heparin, transitioned to dual antiplatelet therapy and high-intensity statin, and discharged with a 30-day cardiac event monitor. No arrhythmia was detected, and her thrombophilia workup was negative. Follow-up CT angiography 1 month later revealed complete resolution of the renal artery stenosis, with no residual narrowing or plaque. The transient nature of the vascular finding, along with the lack of structural atherosclerosis, prompted diagnostic reassessment, favoring an embolic mechanism possibly related to multiple modifiable prothrombotic clinical risk factors and unrecognized embolic sources. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates the importance of follow-up imaging and clinical reassessment in differentiating embolic from atherosclerotic causes of renal infarction."

This study investigates the prevalence, characteristics, and health outcomes of IF among adults in Saudi Arabia. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh from February to May 2024, involving Saudi adults. Data were gathered through electronic questionnaires, using convenience sampling. The questionnaire included sections on demographics, IF status, chronic diseases, fasting patterns, health impacts, and motivations for IF. RESULTS The study found that 60.3% of participants practiced IF. The most common chronic conditions were obesity (11.5%), diabetes (9.7%), and heart disease (8.0%). Symptoms experienced during fasting included energy deficiency (18%), hunger (17.7%), and dizziness (17.7%). Among 109 participants, 33% practiced IF for less than a week, and 12.7% for more than 2 weeks. Notably, 17.7% followed a 12-h fasting pattern, while 15.0% adhered to a 16-h fasting schedule. Weight loss varied, with 11.5% losing less than 2 kg, 16.5% losing 3 kg, and 9% losing between 5 and 9.9 kg. The primary motivations for IF were weight loss (27.4%) and health improvement (26.5%). Additionally, 35.7% reported feeling better, and 22.7% experienced great health benefits after IF. CONCLUSIONS A significant number of individuals engage in IF, with diverse patterns and motivations. The study results showed meaningful weight loss and health improvements among participants, suggesting IF may offer beneficial health outcomes. These insights underscore the potential of IF as a viable strategy for health management in Saudi Arabia."

Finding an effective intervention to improve patient adherence is challenging. To evaluate the effect of telehealth through short messaging services (SMSs) on adherence to statins in patients with diabetes. This was a randomized clinical trial. Patients with diabetes mellitus were referred to the Center of Diabetes and Endocrinology at Assiut University Hospital and were assessed for eligibility. Ninety participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Reminder SMS messages were regularly sent to the intervention group. Follow-up was performed at 6 and 12 weeks. Medication Adherence Report Scale-5 (MARS-5) and pill counting (PC) were used to measure adherence. The lipid profile, incidence of acute cardiovascular events, and mortality were assessed as secondary outcomes. After six weeks, both groups exhibited similar adherence rates based on the subjective MARS-5 score. However, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better PC adherence than the control group. By the 12-week follow-up, the intervention group showed modest but statistically significant improvements in adherence rates (MARS-5, PC), along with reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-c levels, morbidity, and mortality incidence during the second follow-up period. These improvements were consistently greater in the intervention group compared to the control group (<i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05).

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease, which has a heavy disease burden and seriously affects the reproductive health of women of reproductive age. Therefore, this study assessed the disease burden of T1DM among women of reproductive age worldwide. This study extracted the incidence, prevalence, disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths data of T1DM in women of reproductive age from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database from 1990 to 2021. The percentage change and the Estimated Annual Percentage Change were used to assess the change trend of T1DM burden in women of reproductive age, and the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model was used to predict the future disease burden. Compared to 1990, global incidence, prevalence, DALYs, and deaths cases of T1DM among women of reproductive age had significantly increased in 2021. The global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) rose, while age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) declined. High socio-demographic index (SDI) areas had higher ASIR and ASPR, and lower SDI regions had higher ASDR and ASMR. Younger age groups had higher ASIR, and elder age groups had higher ASPR, ASDR, and ASMR. By 2040, the burden is expected to further increase. In general, from 1990 to 2021, the global burden of T1DM among women of reproductive age significantly increased, especially the rising incidence and prevalence rates, highlighting the need for enhanced management and treatment."

        "Abstract":"Myosteatosis, or fat infiltration in skeletal muscle, impairs muscle quality and contributes to insulin resistance. The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) has emerged as a noninvasive marker of insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to investigate the association between eGDR and myosteatosis in the general population. This cross-sectional study included 18,251 adults who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans as part of health screening examinations. eGDR was calculated using the formula: eGDR\u00a0=\u00a021.16\u00a0-\u00a0(0.09\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0waist circumference [cm])\u00a0-\u00a0(3.41\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0hypertension)\u00a0-\u00a0(0.55 \u00d7 glycated hemoglobin [%]). Patients were categorized into three groups according to eGDR tertiles. To evaluate myosteatosis, the total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) at the L3 vertebral level of the axial CT image was segmented into normal-attenuation muscle area (NAMA), low-attenuation muscle area (LAMA), and inter\/intra-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT). Myosteatosis was defined by the T-score of the NAMA\/TAMA index, which was calculated as: NAMA\/TAMA\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100. As a result, lower eGDR levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of myosteatosis. Adjusted ORs for class I myosteatosis were 3.71 (3.27-4.21) in men and 4.68 (3.97-5.52) in women. The NAMA\/BMI and NAMA\/TAMA indices, which reflect good muscle quality, decreased with lower eGDR, while LAMA\/BMI and IMAT, indicators of poor muscle quality, increased. In the ROC analysis, eGDR outperformed HOMA-IR in predicting myosteatosis risk. This study demonstrated a significant association between decreased eGDR levels and increased myosteatosis, as defined by sex-specific cutoffs of CT-based myosteatosis indices."

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data collected at the inception of the Ravansar Non-communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort study in 2014. A total of 8901 participants aged 35-65 were included in the study. The WWI is calculated by dividing the waist circumference (WC) in centimeters by the square root of the weight in kilograms. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between WWI and T2DM, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Individuals in the second quartile demonstrate a 56\u202f% (OR: 1.56, 95\u202f% CI: 1.23-1.99) higher odds of T2DM compared to those in first quartile. The odds of having T2DM was elevated in the third and fourth quartiles, with odds ratios of 1.81 (95\u202f% CI: 1.43-2.20) and 2.15 (95\u202f% CI: 1.71-2.71) respectively. After adjusting confounder variables, it is evident that the odds of diabetes in the second, third, and fourth quartiles of WWI has increased by 38\u202f% (95\u202f% CI: 1.07, 1.78), 47\u202f% (95\u202f% CI: 1.14, 1.91), and 43\u202f% (95\u202f% CI: 1.08, 1.89) respectively, compared to the first quartile (P trend = 0.001). The results of the current study indicate that high levels of WWI are strongly associated to a higher risk of T2DM in Iranian adults.

In addition to its metabolic effects, PIO exhibits various biological activities, including potential anticancer effects. However, its efficacy and mechanistic relevance in the development and progression of cancer, including urothelial carcinoma, remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the functional impact of PIO on urothelial tumorigenesis. An <i>in vitro<\/i> urothelial neoplastic transformation model was established by inducing SV-HUC-1 cells with a chemical carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene. This model was used to investigate the effects of PIO on neoplastic\/malignant transformation. PIO significantly inhibited the neoplastic\/malignant transformation of SV-HUC-1 cells. Moreover, PIO treatment up-regulated tumor suppressors, including p53 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), as well as the epithelial marker E-cadherin, while down-regulating the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and the oncogenic factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), as confirmed by protein and mRNA expression analyses.

We retrospectively examined 89 patients who underwent BETLIF using a double cage (3D-printed titanium, 48 levels; PEEK, 46 levels). Fusion status and subsidence were assessed using dynamic plain lateral lumbar spine radiographs and computed tomography images at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Fusion was graded according to the Bridwell system, and significant subsidence was defined as \u22652 mm endplate depression on computed tomography. Demographic and clinical variables, including age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, history of tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, bone mineral density measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, cage length, and cage material, were collected and analyzed as potential risk factors. At 1-year follow-up, fusion grades were I (75.0%, 36 levels), II (20.8%, 10 levels), and III (4.2%, 2 levels) for 3D-printed titanium and I (53.2%, 25 levels), II (40.4%, 19 levels), and III (6.4%, 3 levels) for PEEK. The overall fusion rate (grades I and II) was similar for both cages (95.8% vs 93.6%, <i>P<\/i> = 0.629), but grade I was more prevalent with 3D-printed titanium than with PEEK (75.0% vs 53.2%, <i>P<\/i> = 0.027). No significant differences were observed in subsidence or complications between the 2 cages. Multivariate analysis revealed age as the only variable significantly associated with subsidence in BETLIF. Both double 3D-printed titanium and PEEK cages demonstrated high fusion rates with no significant differences in overall success. However, double 3D-printed titanium cages showed better early fusion grades and comparable subsidence to that of PEEK cages. Although long-term follow-up is necessary to ascertain efficacy, these findings suggest that 3D-printed titanium cages offer advantages in early fusion quality in BETLIF. Further research is needed to optimize cage arrangement, cage design, and surgical techniques to improve outcomes. The use of double 3D-printed titanium cages is recommended in BETLIF."

To assess the prevalence of pancreatic lesions in patients hospitalized for newly diagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and identify potential predictive factors for pancreatic pathology. We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study at Brest University Hospital between February 2016 and February 2022. Adult patients hospitalized for newly diagnosed diabetes or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus who underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan within six months of admission were included. Patients with type 1 diabetes, prior pancreatectomy, or a known history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were excluded. Clinical, biological, and imaging data were analyzed. Among 412 patients analyzed, 53 (12.9%) presented pancreatic abnormalities (PA), including 11 cases (2.7%) of malignant pancreatic lesion. Predictive factors for PA (P <0.05) included (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]): age \u2265 65 years (2.00 [1.52;5.27]); body mass index \u2264 26.4 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (2.65 [1.1;4.98]); LDL\/HDL ratio \u2264 3.0 (4.75 [2.03;11.10]); and presence of at least one clinical warning sign (alcoholic use, steatorrhea, abdominal pain) (2.29 [1.21;4.33]). Using all four criteria together, 68 of 412 CT scans would have been avoided, with no missed cases. The prevalence of pancreatic lesions in patients hospitalized for diabetes-related glycemic imbalance was significant although malignancy remained low. Age \u2265 65 years, low body mass index, and altered lipid profile may help identify patients requiring pancreatic imaging. Future prospective studies should refine these criteria to develop screening strategies for early pancreatic cancer detection in high-risk selected diabetic populations."

This study aimed to investigate differences in fracture patterns and T1DM-specific outcomes between children and adolescents with\/without T1DM. This retrospective observational study assessed differences in fracture patterns and outcomes among hospitalized children and adolescents (ages 5-19) with and without T1DM using the United State (US) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Children and adolescents treated for limb fractures via closed\/open reduction or debridement were analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) balanced baseline characteristics, yielding 295 T1DM patients and 2950 non-T1DM controls. Outcomes were examined using in-hospital outcomes from the NIS database. Among 135,981 children and adolescents (mean age: 13; 68.1\u202f% male), tibia\/fibula fractures were most common (28.6\u202f%), and 52.3\u202f% underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). No significant differences in fracture site were found between T1DM and non-T1DM groups. However, children and adolescents with T1DM had higher odds of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.20; 95\u202f% CI: 1.07-4.52) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (aOR: 4.59; 95\u202f% CI: 2.02-10.44). Age-stratified analysis revealed elevated VTE risk (aOR: 5.25) and prolonged ventilation (aOR: 2.02) in T1DM children and adolescents aged 10-14, and higher AKI risk (aOR: 3.42) in those aged 15-19. Among T1DM patients, VTE risk was highest with upper limb fractures (aOR: 7.73), while AKI risk increased with lower limb fractures (aOR: 9.83). Children and adolescents with T1DM do not differ in fracture patterns but are at higher risk for complications, particularly VTE and AKI. These findings highlight the need for vigilant perioperative care and further studies with detailed clinical data and long-term follow-up to guide management strategies."

As the name \"poly\" indicates, several peripheral nerves are affected. Depending on the cause, motor, sensory or even autonomic nerves can be affected individually or in combination. Sensory and motor symptoms occur (sensitive: numbness, prickling, tingling, unsteady gait and sharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain; motor: muscle cramps, muscle weakness, skeletal deformities). Clinically, polyneuropathies usually present insidiously with these symptoms and frequently with pain in the feet, often symmetrical and distally emphasized (\"stocking pattern\"). The disease can affect the insulating layer of the nerves (myelin) and\/or the extension of the nerve cell (neurite, axon) itself. The etiology is diverse, ranging from metabolic to toxic to genetic causes. Early diagnosis is crucial in order to treat any underlying disease and, if possible, prevent progression and complications. This paper describes the causes of polyneuropathies and, in particular, a valuable diagnostic procedure for investigating the causes. It is emphasized that the physiological loss of nerve fibers in older patients can also be the cause of a (mild) polyneuropathy or, in the sense of a \"double crash\", can trigger a clinically manifest polyneuropathy together with another possible cause."

        "Abstract":"CD36 is a multifunctional lipid transporter that facilitates long-chain fatty acid uptake and orchestrates metabolic signaling in energy-demanding tissues. Recent studies have uncovered site-specific palmitoylation as a crucial post-translational modification that governs CD36 subcellular trafficking, stabilizing its localization within lipid rafts and regulating its endocytic recycling between the plasma membrane, endosomes, and lipid droplets. This dynamic palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle enables CD36 to spatially and temporally couple lipid transport with signal transduction in response to nutritional and hormonal cues. Disruption of this regulatory axis leads to aberrant fatty acid uptake, inflammatory activation, and metabolic dysfunction, contributing to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherosclerosis. Here, we delineate the mechanistic basis of CD36 palmitoylation-dependent trafficking and its integration with lipid handling, signal transduction, and disease pathogenesis. Targeting this regulatory interface offers a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, with pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and oxidative stress playing central roles in its pathogenesis. Recent studies have identified disulfidptosis as a novel form of regulated cell death driven by disulfide stress\uff0ca condition marked by abnormal intracellular disulfide accumulation and NADPH\/NADP+\u202fimbalance. This process is particularly prominent in glucose-deprived cells with high expression of the cystine transporter SLC7A11, where impaired disulfide reduction leads to cytoskeletal collapse and cell death. Disulfide stress arises from multiple sources, including persistent protein glutathionylation, aberrant disulfide bond formation in cysteine-rich proteins, and irreversible oxidation of thiol groups. Beyond triggering disulfidptosis, disulfide stress exacerbates oxidative damage and inflammatory responses through complex signaling cascades, contributing to DM progression. This review systematically examines the molecular mechanisms of disulfidptosis, highlighting its interplay with redox systems such as thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx). We further explore how disulfide stress influences the pathophysiology of DM complications, including diabetic nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, vascular dysfunction, and retinopathy, with emphasis on the dual roles of the Trx-interacting protein (TXNIP) in these processes. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting disulfide stress, such as TXNIP inhibition and redox system modulation, to preserve \u03b2-cell function and mitigate end-organ damage. By integrating current evidence this review provides a framework for developing targeted interventions to improve DM management in the coming years."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), as one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus, have emerged as a critical global public health challenge due to their high incidence, refractory nature, and serious adverse outcomes. Clinical evidence demonstrates that while conventional therapies-including wound debridement, pharmacological treatment, and surgical intervention-can partially improve wound healing, they remain limited by suboptimal efficacy and high complication rates. In recent years, breakthroughs in smart dressing technology, enabled by advanced materials and biosensing innovations, have provided transformative solutions to this clinical dilemma. This review systematically analyzes the pathological characteristics and therapeutic challenges of DFUs, with an in-depth examination of the inherent limitations of traditional dressings, particularly their functional simplicity and uncontrolled drug release profiles. Studies reveal that next-generation smart dressings, through the integration of microenvironment-responsive materials, multifunctional sensor systems, and programmable drug delivery platforms, achieve real-time monitoring and dynamic regulation of critical wound parameters, including temperature, pH, moisture levels, and inflammatory biomarkers. Notably, these advanced dressings intelligently modulate the release kinetics of therapeutic agents (e.g., antimicrobials and growth factors) in response to microenvironmental changes, thereby significantly enhancing treatment efficacy. Furthermore, the convergence of smart dressing technology with telemedicine and artificial intelligence is revolutionizing wound management toward precision, personalization, and intelligent care, offering novel clinical pathways for DFUs treatment. Looking ahead, interdisciplinary innovations spanning materials science, biomedical engineering, and information technology are expected to establish smart dressings as a groundbreaking therapeutic modality for improving DFUs outcomes."

        "Abstract":"This study examined the effects of treatment-related decisional conflict, parental self-efficacy, and nursing support on parents' perceptions of shared decision-making for children with type 1 diabetes, using the ODSF (Ottawa Decision Support Framework). It also sought to provide foundational data for developing nursing interventions that enhance these perceptions METHODS: Data were collected with a structured questionnaire measuring decisional conflict, parental self-efficacy, nurse-parent support, and shared decision-making. Participants were 137 primary caregivers of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus who were receiving outpatient or inpatient care. Participants were recruited from Chonnam National University Hospital in Gwangju Metropolitan City and from diabetes mellitus online community in South Korea. Data collection was conducted via online questionnaires from June through august 2024 RESULTS: Factors that significantly affected perceptions of shared decision-making were having a college degree or higher (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), having only one child (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.21, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026), and experiencing decisional conflict (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.17, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036).

        "Abstract":"With opportunistic fungal pathogens increasingly recognized as a global public health threat, the population at high risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has expanded beyond traditionally immunocompromised individuals-such as those with malignancies, organ transplantation, diabetes mellitus, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-to include critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receiving invasive support and immunomodulatory therapies. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is one of the most lethal opportunistic infections in this population, characterized by insidious onset, clinical heterogeneity, and a lack of specific signs, often resulting in delayed diagnosis. Disseminated or breakthrough aspergillosis carries an exceedingly high mortality rate. We report the case of a female patient admitted to the ICU with fulminant myocarditis who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and immunomodulation. Her hospitalization was complicated by a progressive pulmonary infection, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of respiratory specimens identified Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp. and Staphylococcus hominis, prompting an adjustment in antimicrobial therapy. Subsequently, the patient developed multiple cutaneous nodules, which tissue biopsy and mNGS confirmed as invasive cutaneous aspergillosis. Despite aggressive antifungal treatment with isavuconazole and amphotericin B, her condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to disseminated cutaneous necrosis, irreversible septic shock and multiorgan failure. This case highlights the clinical importance of recognizing atypical IFI presentations. Heightened clinical suspicion for disseminated fungal disease is warranted in critically ill patients with extrapulmonary lesions. Prompt microbiological diagnosis and antifungal resistance surveillance are essential for effective antifungal therapy."

        "Abstract":"Recent studies have established a connection between circadian rhythm disruption and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), yet the underlying genetic mechanisms remain inadequately understood. This research aims to elucidate the causal relationships between circadian rhythm-related genes and T2DM by utilising a multi-omics approach. The study employed the GeneCards database to identify genes associated with circadian rhythms. Integration of quantitative trait loci (QTL) data for gene expression (eQTLs), DNA methylation (mQTLs), and protein expression (pQTLs) was conducted alongside genome-wide association study summary data for T2DM sourced from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) and FinnGen databases. The summary-databased Mendelian randomization (SMR) methodology was utilised to analyse potential causal relationships, supported by colocalisation analyses to confirm the origin of genetic signals. The analysis yielded 47 mQTLs, five eQTLs, and three pQTLs significantly correlated with T2DM outcomes, maintaining a significance threshold of P_SMR_multi <0.05, P_SMR<0.05, and P-HEIDI>0.01. The integration of mQTL and eQTL data identified 20 critical methylation sites and 13 associated genes relevant to T2DM, with Heat Shock Factor 1(HSF1) emerging as a pivotal gene. Notably, high methylation at the site cg18814314 was inversely correlated with T2DM risk, while increased expression of HSF1 showed a positive correlation. These findings suggest that HSF1 plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of T2DM through circadian rhythm regulation, highlighting its potential as a target for early intervention strategies. Further research is warranted to investigate the timing of circadian gene expression and methylation in T2DM development."

Eligible participants were adults with T1D recruited from four general practices in southeast England. Phase 1 included screening measures for mental disorders in the DSM-5. Participants at phase 1 were invited to a structured clinical interview for DSM-5 at phase 2. Feasibility parameters included the proportions of those identified as eligible, consenting, and completing either or both phases, and acceptability. The study population comprised 146 adults with T1D.\u00a072% (n\u2009=\u2009105) had correct contact details, were eligible and invited. 52% (n\u2009=\u200955) completed phase 1, of which 45% (n\u2009=\u200925) completed phase 2. Some measures had high rates of missing values and three mental disorders had concordant phase 1-2 pairs, namely schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, depressive disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders. Conducting a two-phase survey of mental disorders in people with T1D is feasible and acceptable and can be improved using methods to update current contact details; adding secondary care diabetes services (hospitals) as recruitment sites; reducing the screening measures; and omitting diagnostic interviews for those mental disorders already listed in routine medical records."

        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is considered the most common complication of pregnancy, and is a very dangerous disease for both mother and baby. Homeobox A13 (HOXA13) has been discovered to join into some diseases through exhibiting regulatory functions. Importantly, hypermethylation of HOXA13 has been observed in the placental tissues of preeclampsia. However, the regulatory impacts of HOXA13 on GDM progression keep dimness. The GDM cell model and GDM rat model were established. The expressions of genes were measured through RT-qPCR, western blot or IHC assay. The cell proliferation was tested through MTT and Edu assays. The cell migration was determined through Transwell assay. The fasting blood glucose of rats was detected through the blood glucose meter. HOXA13 was verified to be lowly expressed in placental tissues from GDM patients. In addition, the cell proliferation and migration abilities of trophoblast cells were attenuated after high glucose (HG) treatment, but these impacts were counteracted after HOXA13 overexpression. It was further demonstrated that HOXA13 affected the proliferation and migration abilities of HG-triggered trophoblast cells by enhancing smad2 expression. At last, it was testified that HOXA13 can ameliorate GDM symptoms in vivo. This study manifested that HOXA13 accelerated HG-triggered trophoblast cell growth and migration by regulating the smad2 pathway. This discovery hinted that HOXA13 may be a target for ameliorating GDM."

        "Abstract":"Foot disease is a leading cause of national disease burdens and is driven by diabetes. General practitioners (GPs) play a gatekeeper role in many national healthcare systems. Yet, national foot disease management by GPs has not been explored. We explored the management of foot disease by Australian GPs in people with and without diabetes. We analysed 16\u00a0years of annual, cross-sectional, GP encounter data from the nationally representative Australian Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health study in which a foot disease problem was managed. Factors independently associated with foot disease encounters by GPs were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Foot disease management rates increased from 11.6 per 1000 GP encounters (95% CI: 10.8-12.5) in 2000-2001 to 14.4 (13.3-15.4) in 2015-2016 and 6.1 (5.7-6.6) to 8.7 (8.1-9.3) per 100 Australian people. The rate of GP foot disease management was 2.4-fold higher in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (31.5 [26.4-36.6] vs. 12.9 [11.8-14.0]). Foot disease encounters were positively associated with diabetes, male patients, older patients, English-speaking backgrounds and having healthcare concession cards (all, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); for patients with diabetes, only males were positively associated. Most frequent management actions used were medications, procedures and pathology with referrals, counselling and imaging least frequent. Australian GP management rates for foot disease are higher than many more well-known health conditions and increasing. GPs frequently manage foot disease with medications and procedures, but relatively rarely counsel or refer. Future strategies to improve GP foot disease management and referrals are needed."

        "Abstract":"Accessing diabetes care requires effort and time. Homelessness often forces individuals to prioritize securing shelter and safety over medical appointments, particularly for the screening and prevention of long-term diabetes complications. We evaluated the effectiveness and costs associated with a point-of-care screening program with expedited referral pathways within two inner-city community sites in Calgary, Canada serving individuals experiencing homelessness. We conducted a non-randomized concurrent-convergent mixed methods pilot study of the program. Adults experiencing homelessness and diabetes were recruited through the host sites and attended two separate visits. At the initial visit, screening for microvascular complications, glycemic monitoring (glycated hemoglobin testing), and footcare were offered. At the follow-up visit, the nurse shared the screening results and arranged specialist referrals. The quantitative strand of the study was comprised of a pre-post assessment, comparing screening completion rates after our program to historical screening over the past two years, based on chart review and patient reports. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to report on patient reflections of the program. Nearly all participants (n\u2009=\u200940) completed the screening tests offered: foot\/peripheral neuropathy (n\u2009=\u200939), retinopathy (n\u2009=\u200930), and diabetic kidney disease (n\u2009=\u200938). This is compared to the previous two years, where only n\u2009=\u200910, n\u2009=\u200911, and n\u2009=\u200920 completed these tests, respectively. While n\u2009=\u200923 had their glycated hemoglobin measured in the past year, n\u2009=\u200940 completed it with our program. Most participants (83%) attended both clinic visits. Despite this unique and well received model, getting participants to see specialists remained challenging, with fewer than half of referred patients attending follow-up visits. The cost of the pilot ($846\/visit) illustrates this model requires modifications to provide even better value. Four main themes emerged from the participant interviews regarding the program that include: improved accessibility to services, positive experiences, ideal locations of service, and willingness to return. This point-of-care screening model significantly increased screening rates from the pre-period and participants indicated interest in and support for the program. However, innovative approaches to enhance the program are required. Potential adjustments include partnering with more community sites servicing this population and expanding the scope of care offered as well as reaching a broader population."

        "Abstract":"Pyogenic liver abscesses are a fatal condition often seen in emergency departments. The major clinical presentations include weakness, anorexia, fever, chills, ventosity and abdominal pain. They occur in immunocompromised individuals who suffer from diabetes mellitus, malignant tumors, hepatocirrhosis, kidney failure, and solid organ transplantation, or those with long-term administration of glucocorticoids. Invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome resulting from hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae often presents with extrahepatic complications such as endophthalmitis, meningitis, brain enlargement, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and spondylitis. Prompt diagnosis is crucial for the treatment of invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome. A 75-year-old Han Chinese female patient who presented to the emergency department primarily for fever accompanied by chills was diagnosed with pyogenic liver abscess complicated with pulmonary infection, involving multiple pus emboli in the branches of the right hepatic vein. The patient accepted intravenous imipenem and cilastatin sodium for anti-infection, and subcutaneous insulin to control hyperglycemia. Percutaneous liver puncture and drainage was performed under ultrasound guidance. During the treatment the patient presented with headache, weakness in both lower limbs and lower back pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed intracranial infection and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging showed infection of the vertebral body, intervertebral disc, and soft tissue. The patient had a liver abscess positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae together with infection of other organs, thus she was eventually diagnosed with invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome. The antibiotics were adjusted according to the site of infection and drug sensitivity test. The patient recovered after percutaneous liver puncture and drainage under ultrasound guidance and anti-infection treatment for 3\u00a0months. Reexamination of abdominal computed tomography, chest computed tomography, brain magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the infectious lesions had disappeared. This medical case report describes a patient with a pyogenic liver abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae who was eventually diagnosed with invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome. Invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome has permanent morbidity, poor quality of life, and lacks warning signs. Despite the complexity of the condition, the patient received effective treatment and the abscess was successfully managed. Through this case, we propose that invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae should be considered for patients with diabetes and fever in the emergency department. Targeted intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage of the abscess are key to the treatment of invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome."

Clinical attachment level (CAL), probing depth (PD), and bleeding on probing (BOP) parameters were assessed. Additionally, xerostomia severity was determined through questionnaire of 11-point xerostomia inventory and OHRQL through 14-point oral health impact profile. (OHIP-14) RESULTS: The mean HbA1C values differed significantly in the two groups with Group I exhibiting values of 6.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45 gm% and Group II with 9.78\u2009\u00b1\u20092.31 gm%.

Similar corresponding values were obtained for xerostomia severity and OHIP-14 scores for OHRQL. On comparison between the groups the periodontal status manifested by clinical parameters exhibited more severity while xerostomia severity and OHRQL, was negatively impacted in Group II patients when compared with Group I. Poor glycaemic control substantially influences periodontal health, xerostomia severity, and oral health-related quality of life. Early periodontal intervention and maintenance of optimal glycaemic control are crucial to improve overall oral and systemic health in diabetic patients. CTRI\/2025\/04\/086064 Date: 30 April 2025."

Fasting blood glucose, 24 hours urinary albumin, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen of mice were detected. H&E and Tunel staining of mice renal tissues were executed to detect histological changes and apoptosis. A cell model of diabetic nephropathy was constructed by inducing mouse podocytes with high glucose. The function of miR-205-5p on viability, apoptosis, and levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione in the diabetic nephropathy cell model was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, Tunel staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Binding of miR-205-5p and vascular endothelial growth factor A was verified by dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Rescue experiment was implemented on the diabetic nephropathy cell model to research whether miR-205-5p regulated diabetic nephropathy development by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were for the detection of gene expression.ResultsThe increased fasting blood glucose, 24\u2005hours urinary albumin, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, the intensified apoptosis and injury, and the down-regulated miR-205-5p were observed in renal tissues. miR-205-5p relieved podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy, as it increased cell viability, decreased cell apoptosis, reduced malondialdehyde, and elevated superoxide dismutase and glutathione in the diabetic nephropathy cell model. Vascular endothelial growth factor A was up-regulated in renal tissues of diabetic nephropathy mice, and directly suppressed by miR-205-5p. Vascular endothelial growth factor A up-regulation abolished the protection of miR-205-5p on the diabetic nephropathy cell model.ConclusionsmiR-205-5p might relieve podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy by suppressing Vascular endothelial growth factor A.

Among the gastrointestinal sites affected by CMV, the colon is the most frequently affected, though rectal involvement is relatively rare. Reactivated CMV proctitis primarily occurs in elderly patients with comorbidities and is quite uncommon in immunocompetent individuals. Patients with reactivated CMV typically present with symptoms such as diarrhea, hematochezia, or tenesmus. We report a case of a female patient with uncontrolled diabetes who presented to the clinic complaining of perianal pain. She had no history of diarrhea or rectal bleeding. Lower GI endoscopy reported a small, localized, approximately 0.5 cm swelling in the proximal anal canal in addition to sigmoid diverticulosis. The biopsy revealed a small ulcer at the anorectal junction caused by CMV and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up before antiviral therapy could be initiated. This case highlights an uncommon presentation of reactivated CMV proctitis in an older diabetic patient presenting solely with perianal pain. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for CMV infection in elderly patients with comorbidities, even when classical colitis symptoms are absent, to avoid delayed diagnosis and management."

An integrative literature review was conducted using the PICO strategy, including observational studies, experimental research, and integrative reviews that examined periodontal disease in NHPs and its association with systemic diseases. A total of eleven studies were analyzed, revealing consistent associations between periodontal disease and systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The reviewed studies identified inflammatory pathways, including elevated cytokines, acute-phase proteins and immune responses, as key mediators linking periodontal disease to systemic dysfunction. Oral pathogens and chronic inflammation were shown to impact distant organs, suggesting a broader role of oral health in systemic disease. The findings support the hypothesis that periodontal disease in NHPs contributes to systemic disease progression and is not merely a localized condition."

It employed a four-round modified Delphi Method to generate draft definitions and try and achieve consensus. A final round used an endorsement survey of the expert-generated definitions distributed to the ESVE and SCE memberships, seeking a simple majority endorsement. A minimum of 20% membership participation was sought. The 10 experts achieved 100% consensus on the definition of 35 adrenal disease-associated concepts, including disease definitions, diagnostic criteria, and test definitions, a disease classification system for CS and hypoadrenocorticism, and a clinical scoring system for CS. Definitions were subsequently assessed by 78 ESVE and SCE members (26% of combined memberships). All definitions achieved a simple majority, ranging from 83.1 to 100%.

The interaction between hyperglycemia, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and thrombosis creates a complex pathological environment that contributes to the progression of CAD and its acute complications, including AMI. Over recent years, there has been a shift in the therapeutic approach to CAD, especially in T2DM patients, where pharmacologic agents originally developed for glycemic control have demonstrated notable cardiovascular benefits beyond glucose regulation. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are at the forefront of this paradigm shift. Initially, these agents were designed to improve glycemic control, but their broader cardiovascular protective effects have become increasingly evident, particularly in patients with CAD. This review aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the mechanistic underpinnings of these agents, the clinical data supporting their cardiovascular benefits, and their potential role for patients with CAD."

In vitro, CBG and THCV modulate SGLT2-related pathways indirectly via TRP channels and CB receptors; direct IC<sub>50<\/sub> values for SGLT2 remain to be determined. In vivo, THCV and CBD demonstrate glucose-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, weight-reducing, anti-inflammatory, and organ-protective effects. Pilot clinical data (n = 62) show that THCV decreases fasting glucose, enhances \u03b2-cell function, and lacks psychoactive side effects. Compared to synthetic inhibitors, phytocannabinoids offer pleiotropic benefits but face challenges of low oral bioavailability, polypharmacology, inter-individual variability, and limited large-scale trials. <b>Discussion<\/b>: While preclinical and early clinical data highlight phytocannabinoids' potential in SGLT2 modulation and broader metabolic improvement, their translation is impeded by significant challenges. These include low oral bioavailability, inconsistent pharmacokinetic profiles, and the absence of standardized formulations, necessitating advanced delivery system development. Furthermore, the inherent polypharmacology of these compounds, while beneficial, demands comprehensive safety assessments for potential off-target effects and drug interactions. The scarcity of large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials and the need for clear regulatory frameworks remain critical hurdles. Addressing these aspects is paramount to fully realize the therapeutic utility of phytocannabinoids as a comprehensive approach to T2DM management. <b>Conclusion<\/b>: Phytocannabinoids represent promising multi-target agents for T2DM through potential SGLT2 modulation and complementary metabolic effects. Future work should focus on pharmacokinetic optimization, precise quantification of SGLT2 inhibition, and robust clinical trials to establish efficacy and safety profiles relative to synthetic inhibitors."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes, a major global healthcare challenge, is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and significantly exacerbates the severity of systemic complications. Iron, an essential element ubiquitously present in biological systems, is involved in many biological processes facilitating cell proliferation and growth. However, excessive iron accumulation promotes oxidative damage through the Fenton reaction, thereby increasing the incidence of diabetes and worsening diabetic complications. Notably, ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a key mechanism underlying diabetes and diabetic complications. In this review, we provide an update on the current understanding of iron metabolism dysregulation in diabetes risk, and disclose the mechanistic links between iron overload and diabetes evidenced in hereditary hemochromatosis and thalassemia. We particularly highlight iron-mediated oxidative stress as a central nexus impairing glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we discuss the significance of dysmetabolic iron and ferroptosis activation in the progression of diabetes and diabetic complications, as well as the possible application of natural products for iron metabolism regulation and ferroptosis-inhibition-targeted therapeutic strategies to treat diabetes and diabetic complications."

        "Title":"Type 2 Diabetes and the Multifaceted Gut-X Axes.",
        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion. Beyond the classically implicated organs, emerging evidence highlights the gut as a central player in T2D pathophysiology through its interactions with metabolic organs. The gut hosts trillions of microbes and enteroendocrine cells that influence inflammation, energy homeostasis, and hormone regulation. Disruptions in gut homeostasis (dysbiosis and increased permeability) have been linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and \u03b2-cell dysfunction, suggesting multifaceted \"Gut-X axes\" contribute to T2D development. We aimed to comprehensively review the evidence for gut-mediated crosstalk with the pancreas, endocrine system, liver, and kidneys in T2D. Key molecular mechanisms (incretins, bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, endotoxins, etc.) were examined to construct an integrated model of how gut-derived signals modulate metabolic and inflammatory pathways across organs. We also discuss clinical implications of targeting Gut-X axes and identify knowledge gaps and future research directions. A literature search (2015-2025) was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, following PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews). Over 150 high-impact publications (original research and review articles from <i>Nature<\/i>, <i>Cell<\/i>, <i>Gut<\/i>, <i>Diabetologia<\/i>, <i>Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology<\/i>, etc.) were screened. Data on gut microbiota, enteroendocrine hormones, inflammatory mediators, and organ-specific outcomes in T2D were extracted. The GRADE framework was used informally to prioritize high-quality evidence (e.g., human trials and meta-analyses) in formulating conclusions. T2D involves perturbations in multiple Gut-X axes. This review first outlines gut homeostasis and T2D pathogenesis, then dissects each axis: <b>(1) Gut-Pancreas Axis:<\/b> how incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) and microbial metabolites affect insulin\/glucagon secretion and \u03b2-cell health; <b>(2) Gut-Endocrine Axis:<\/b> enteroendocrine signals (e.g., PYY and ghrelin) and neural pathways that link the gut with appetite regulation, adipose tissue, and systemic metabolism; <b>(3) Gut-Liver Axis:<\/b> the role of microbiota-modified bile acids (FXR\/TGR5 pathways) and bacterial endotoxins in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance; <b>(4) Gut-Kidney Axis:<\/b> how gut-derived toxins and nutrient handling intersect with diabetic kidney disease and how incretin-based and SGLT2 inhibitor therapies leverage gut-kidney communication. Shared mechanisms (microbial SCFAs improving insulin sensitivity, LPS driving inflammation via TLR4, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands modulating immunity) are synthesized into a unified model. An integrated understanding of Gut-X axes reveals new opportunities for treating and preventing T2D. Modulating the gut microbiome and its metabolites (through diet, pharmaceuticals, or microbiota therapies) can improve glycemic control and ameliorate complications by simultaneously influencing pancreatic islet function, hepatic metabolism, and systemic inflammation. However, translating these insights into clinical practice requires addressing gaps with robust human studies. This review provides a state-of-the-art synthesis for researchers and clinicians, underlining the gut as a nexus for multi-organ metabolic regulation in T2D and a fertile target for next-generation therapies."

While diet and body composition influence metabolic and renal health, their combined role remains underexplored. This study investigates the association between the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI), body mass distribution, and the prevalence of CKD and DKD in U.S. adults. <b>Methods<\/b>: We analyzed data from 8093 adults aged \u226540 years from NHANES 2003-2018. PHDI was computed using two 24 h dietary recalls. Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), focusing on the android-to-gynoid fat ratio (AGFR) and lean mass ratio (AGLR). Survey-weighted linear and logistic regressions evaluated cross-sectional associations between PHDI score, body composition indices, and prevalence of CKD and DKD. Mediation analyses explored AGLR, AGFR, and body mass index (BMI) as potential mediators of the association between PHDI score and either CKD or DKD. <b>Results<\/b>: Higher PHDI scores were mildly associated with lower odds of CKD (OR per 10-point increase: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83-0.99) and DKD (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76-0.97). Greater PHDI scores correlated with lower BMI, AGFR, and AGLR. Among participants with diabetes, AGLR mediated 17% of the relationship between a 10-point increase in PHDI score and decreased DKD prevalence, suggesting central lean mass distribution as a relevant pathway. No significant mediation was observed for AGFR, BMI, or for CKD. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> Adherence to PHD is associated with healthier body composition and lower prevalence of CKD and DKD. These findings support the promotion of dietary strategies that enhance metabolic and renal health in middle-aged and older individuals."

        "Abstract":"The present article is an opinion piece mainly based on selected articles in the field of sarcopenia, with possible relevance for pregnancy. Sarcopenia has gained increasing interest in recent years, since it has emerged that sarcopenia may determine significant health consequences, with related substantial health care expenditure. In particular, some studies suggested that sarcopenia may cause increased risk for several diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and major cardiovascular events. On the other hand, some studies have reported that the association between sarcopenia and these diseases may be bidirectional. In particular, this holds for type 2 diabetes, because sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes share many etiological and pathogenetic factors, such as insulin resistance, oxidative stress, low-grade chronic inflammation, and adiposity. It is also worth noting that some studies have shown a non-negligible sarcopenia prevalence even in people below 40 years of age, and therefore of reproductive age. Taken together, the above considerations support the hypothesis that sarcopenia may be present in women with gestational diabetes (GDM), which shares common traits with type 2 diabetes. Notably, we hypothesize that sarcopenia may exacerbate GDM-related complications and may influence maternal-fetal outcomes, such as preterm birth or cesarean delivery. Additionally, since pregnancy often presents with insulin resistance independently of any comorbidity, it is plausible that sarcopenia may be present during pregnancy even in cases of normal glycemia. However, there is a lack of data about sarcopenia prevalence in pregnancy and its potential impact on outcomes. Therefore, future studies addressing these aspects are advisable."

Liubao tea (LBT) has demonstrated beneficial effects on gut microbiota and glucose-lipid metabolism, holding promising therapeutic potential for T2D; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the potential mechanisms of Liubao tea extract (LBTE) against T2D. <b>Methods<\/b>: LC-MS technology was used to identify the chemical components of LBTE and combined with network pharmacology and molecular docking to screen its potential active ingredients and targets for improving T2D. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed in high-fat diet\/streptozotocin (HFD\/STZ)-induced diabetic mice via serum biochemical analyses and histopathological examinations. Serum metabolomics, 16S rRNA sequencing, quantification of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and antibiotic-treated pseudo-germ-free models were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. <b>Results<\/b>: LBTE effectively reduced blood glucose levels and improved lipid metabolism, primarily by promoting hepatic glycogen synthesis and suppressing glycerophospholipid synthesis. LBTE also alleviated hepatic inflammation by modulating inflammatory cytokine expression. Additionally, LBTE reshaped the gut microbiota profiles by decreasing harmful bacteria and increasing SCFA-producing bacteria, resulting in elevated fecal SCFAs. SCFAs contributed to improving hepatic metabolism and inflammation, enhancing intestinal barrier function. Notably, these effects were abolished by antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion, confirming the microbiota-dependent mechanism of LBTE. Quercetin, luteolin, genistein, and kaempferol were considered as potential active ingredients contributing to the antidiabetic effects of LBTE. <b>Conclusions<\/b>: These findings provide novel perspectives on the viability of LBTE as a complementary strategy for T2D prevention and management."

        "Abstract":"Chlorophyll, the green pigment essential for photosynthesis, abundantly found in green vegetables and algae, has attracted growing scientific interest for its potential therapeutic effects, particularly in diabetes management. Recent research highlighted that chlorophyll and its derivatives may beneficially influence glucose metabolism and oxidative stress, key factors in diabetes. This review examines current knowledge on how chlorophyll compounds could aid diabetes control. Chlorophyll and its derivatives appear to support glucose regulation primarily through actions in the gastrointestinal tract. They modulate gut microbiota, improve glucose tolerance, reduce inflammation, and alleviate obesity-related markers. While chlorophyll itself does not directly inhibit digestive enzymes like \u03b1-glucosidase, its derivatives such as pheophorbide <i>a<\/i>, pheophytin <i>a<\/i>, and pyropheophytin <i>a<\/i> may slow carbohydrate digestion, acting as \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, reducing postprandial glucose spikes. Additionally, chlorophyll enhances resistant starch content, further controlling glucose absorption. Beyond digestion, chlorophyll derivatives show promise in inhibiting glycation processes, improving insulin sensitivity through nuclear receptor modulation, and lowering oxidative stress. However, some compounds pose risks due to photosensitizing effects and toxicity, warranting careful consideration. Chlorophyllin, a stable semi-synthetic derivative, also shows potential in improving glucose and lipid metabolism. Notably, pheophorbide <i>a<\/i> demonstrates insulin-mimetic activity by stimulating glucose uptake via glucose transporters, offering a novel therapeutic avenue. Overall, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-mimicking properties of chlorophyll derivatives suggest a multifaceted approach to diabetes management. While promising, these findings require further clinical validation to establish effective therapeutic applications."

With the global incidence of hip fractures anticipated to rise significantly, understanding these associations is crucial, especially considering the higher prevalence of sarcopenia in diabetic patients, which exacerbates outcomes. An observational, unicentric case-control study nested within a real-world data cohort was conducted. It included 2631 older adults (aged \u2265 70 years) hospitalized for hip fractures at the Hospital Universitario de la Ribera, Spain, from 2014 to 2021. Diabetic patients were classified as cases, and non-diabetic patients served as controls. The study examined demographic variables, comorbidities, nutritional status, geriatric syndromes, and mortality, using the SARC-F questionnaire for sarcopenia screening. The study found that cases (diabetic patients) presented with higher comorbidities, longer hospital stays, and a higher prevalence of sarcopenia, significantly impacting in-hospital and long-term mortality rates. The prevalence of possible sarcopenia was notably higher at 61.5% among diabetic patients. Sarcopenia was strongly correlated with worse functional outcomes and higher mortality. Sarcopenic diabetes significantly increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality in older adults with hip fractures. The findings underscore the importance of routine screening for diabetes and sarcopenia in this patient population to mitigate risks and improve rehabilitation outcomes."

This condition can result in severe complications, including cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, vision impairment, and nerve damage. Currently available anti-diabetic drugs do not fully prevent the progression of these complications. Moreover, they often have significant side effects. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in influencing diet, energy metabolism, and blood glucose levels. Research shows a strong link between microbiota dysbiosis and DM, as well as the severity of its complications.

GLP-1 RAs demonstrate pleiotropic effects through fundamental cellular mechanisms, including enhanced mitochondrial function, anti-inflammatory actions, improved cellular quality control, and comprehensive metabolic regulation. Established applications demonstrate robust efficacy in diabetes management (HbA1c reductions of 1.5-2.0%), obesity treatment (weight loss of 7-24%), and cardiovascular protection (14-20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE). Emerging applications span neurological disorders, dermatological conditions, respiratory diseases, and novel applications in addiction medicine and autoimmune disorders. GLP-1 RAs represent a paradigmatic shift toward multi-system therapeutic intervention, with expanding evidence supporting their role as comprehensive metabolic modulators."

        "Abstract":"<b>Background\/Objectives<\/b>: The <i>transcription factor 7-like 2<\/i> (<i>TCF7L2<\/i>) rs7903146 polymorphism has been strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in various populations; however, its impact on different ethnic groups is not fully understood. Given the distinct minor allele frequency in Chinese populations, this study aimed to analyze the association of rs7903146 with the risk of T2DM in a Han Chinese cohort and its relationship with relevant clinical parameters. <b>Methods<\/b>: We conducted a case-control study including 600 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 511 sex-matched non-diabetic controls of Han Chinese descent. The <i>TCF7L2<\/i> rs7903146 (C\/T) polymorphism was genotyped using a TaqMan\u2122 SNP assay. Clinical parameters, including body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were compared between genotypes. Logistic regression analyses were performed under a dominant genetic model (CT\/TT vs. CC), adjusting for age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and smoking status. Subgroup analyses were conducted by sex, BMI category, age at diagnosis, and family history of T2DM. Given the exploratory nature of this study and the low frequency of the TT genotype, no formal correction for multiple testing was applied. <b>Results<\/b>: Frequencies of the CT and TT genotypes were higher in the diabetic group (<i>p<\/i> = 0.045) and were significantly associated with an increased risk of T2DM under a dominant genetic model (adjusted OR = 2.24, <i>p<\/i> = 0.025). Individuals with CT\/TT genotypes had elevated fasting glucose and hs-CRP levels; these genotypes were also linked to higher BMI in the female T2DM patients. The T allele frequency varied across ethnic groups, being lowest in East Asians and highest in Latin (Brazilian\/mixed ancestry) populations. Mechanistically, the T allele may contribute to T2DM via altered <i>TCF7L2<\/i> expression, impaired insulin secretion, inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation. <b>Conclusions<\/b>: The <i>TCF7L2<\/i> rs7903146 T allele was associated with an increased risk of T2DM and higher fasting glucose and hs-CRP levels in this Han Chinese cohort. The CT\/TT genotypes were also associated with higher BMI in the female T2DM patients. While the findings are consistent with the known effects of this variant in other populations, mechanistic hypotheses such as the involvement of inflammatory or metabolic pathways remain hypothetical and warrant further functional validation."

        "Abstract":"<b>Background\/Objectives<\/b>: Hypertension is a growing public health concern in Saudi Arabia, driven by rapid socioeconomic changes. This study investigated the interplay between habitual, behavioral, and dietary risk factors associated with hypertension among Saudi adults. <b>Methods<\/b>: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 3312 Saudi adults using multistage stratified random sampling. The data were collected via validated questionnaires assessing sociodemographic, anthropometric indicators, lifestyle behaviors, dietary patterns, and medical history. Hypertension status was determined through self-reported diagnosis. Bivariate analyses and multiple logistic regression identified independent predictors (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). <b>Results<\/b>: Hypertension prevalence was 13% (mean age: 34 \u00b1 15 years; 50% male). The strongest predictors were age (OR = 1.08\/year; 95% CI: 1.07-1.10; <i>p<\/i> < 0.001), increased body mass index (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06; <i>p<\/i> = 0.011), smoking (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.04-2.29; <i>p<\/i> = 0.030), and family history of hypertension (OR = 7.71; 95% CI: 5.61-10.75; <i>p<\/i> < 0.001). Participants with diabetes mellitus had 89% higher odds of hypertension (OR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.42-2.51; <i>p<\/i> < 0.001), and those with dyslipidemia had more than double the odds (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.38-4.22; <i>p<\/i> = 0.002).

        "Abstract":"<b>Background\/Objectives:<\/b> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with several well-established risk factors. Among dermatological conditions, psoriasis is a well-known contributor to cardiometabolic risk, while lichen planus (LP) remains an underexplored chronic inflammatory disorder in this context. This study aimed to comparatively assess the prevalence and clinical patterns of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components in patients with LP versus psoriasis and healthy controls, focusing on the intrinsic inflammatory burden in patients not receiving systemic therapy. We also examined whether specific clinical subtypes of LP carry distinct metabolic profiles. <b>Methods:<\/b> We conducted a cross-sectional observational study at a tertiary dermatology center between January 2020 and December 2024. A total of 236 adult patients were included: 78 with LP, 79 with psoriasis, and 79 controls with minor dermatological conditions. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. LP subtypes (cutaneous, mucocutaneous, reticular oral, erosive oral) were evaluated using the Lichen Planus Activity Index (LPAI) and Oral Lichen Planus Clinical Index (OLP-CI); psoriasis severity was assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Cardiometabolic comorbidities were assessed according to established guidelines. <b>Results:<\/b> LP patients showed significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (OR 1.94, <i>p<\/i> = 0.044) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 3.09, <i>p<\/i> = 0.015) compared to controls. Compared to psoriasis, LP was associated with a higher prevalence of mixed dyslipidemia (OR 3.41, <i>p<\/i> = 0.033), while psoriasis showed more abdominal obesity (OR 0.35, <i>p<\/i> = 0.003). Mucosal LP subtypes, especially erosive and reticular oral LP, were linked to elevated cardiometabolic risk. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> LP, particularly its oral subtypes, is associated with a distinct cardiometabolic risk profile comparable to or exceeding that of psoriasis. These findings support the need for systematic metabolic screening in LP patients as part of comprehensive care."

        "Abstract":"<b>Background\/Objectives:<\/b> Microvascular complications are a major source of disability in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We investigated whether body composition indices derived from multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) independently predict neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and stroke, and whether they improve risk discrimination beyond the established clinical variables. <b>Methods:<\/b> In this cross-sectional analytical study (March 2024-February 2025), 124 adults with T2DM \u2265 12 months attending the outpatient diabetes clinic of the Universidad T\u00e9cnica de Ambato (Ecuador) were enrolled. After an overnight fast and 15 min supine rest, thirteen whole-body BIA metrics including skeletal muscle mass (SMM), intracellular water (ICW), phase angle (PhA), and visceral fat area (VFA) were obtained with a segmental analyzer (InBody S10). Complications were ascertained with standard clinical and laboratory protocols. Principal component analysis (PCA) summarized the correlated BIA measures; multivariable logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, diabetes duration, HbA1c, BMI, and medication use) generated odds ratios (ORs) per standard deviation (SD). Discrimination was assessed with bootstrapped receiver-operating characteristic curves. <b>Results:<\/b> The first principal component, driven by SMM, ICW, and PhA, accounted for a median 68% (range 65-72%) of body composition variance across all complications. Each SD increase in SMM lowered the odds of neuropathy (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71) and nephropathy (OR 0.70, 0.53-0.92), whereas VFA raised the risk of neuropathy (OR 1.55, 1.22-1.97) and retinopathy (OR 1.47, 1.14-1.88). PhA protected most strongly against stroke (OR 0.55, 0.37-0.82). Composite models integrating SMM, PhA, and adiposity indices achieved AUCs of 0.79-0.85, outperforming clinical models alone (all \u0394AUC \u2265 0.05) and maintaining good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow <i>p<\/i> > 0.20). Optimal probability cut-offs (0.39-0.45) balanced sensitivity (0.74-0.80) and specificity (0.68-0.72). <b>Conclusions:<\/b> A lean tissue BIA signature (higher SMM, ICW, PhA) confers independent protection against neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and stroke, whereas visceral adiposity amplifies the risk. Because the assessment is rapid, inexpensive, and operator-independent, routine multifrequency BIA can be embedded into diabetes clinics to triage patients for early specialist referral and to monitor interventions aimed at preserving muscle and reducing visceral fat, thereby enhancing microvascular risk management in T2DM."

The neutrophil\/albumin ratio (NAR) is a novel promising biomarker in assessing cardiovascular disease severity. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between NAR and lesion severity in patients with carotid artery stenosis. <i>Materials and Methods<\/i>: This retrospective, single-center, comparative study included 625 asymptomatic patients who underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for suspected high-grade carotid artery stenosis between 2012 and 2022. Patients were classified into two groups based on stenosis severity: critical carotid artery stenosis (\u226570% stenosis) and non-critical carotid artery stenosis (<70%). Only asymptomatic patients were included; patients with symptoms were excluded. NAR was calculated preoperatively as neutrophil count divided by serum albumin. Additional inflammatory markers, such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR), were also analyzed. <i>Results<\/i>: Severe carotid artery stenosis was detected in 191 of the patients who underwent DSA.

Outcomes were correlated with thermal, anatomical, and systemic factors using statistical analyses, including <i>t<\/i>-tests and Pearson correlation. <i>Results<\/i>: IRT showed high sensitivity (97.4%) and positive predictive value (96.8%) for perforator detection. A total of nine minor complications occurred, predominantly in patients with diabetes mellitus and\/or elevated glycemia (<i>p<\/i> = 0.05). Larger flap-to-defect ratios (A\/C and B\/C) correlated with increased complications in propeller flaps, while smaller ratios posed risks for V-Y and Keystone flaps. Thermal analysis indicated significantly lower flap temperatures and greater temperature gradients in flaps with complications by postoperative day 7 (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). CRP levels correlated with glycemia and white blood cell counts, highlighting systemic inflammation's impact on outcomes. <i>Conclusions<\/i>: IRT proves to be a reliable, non-invasive method for perforator localization and flap monitoring, enhancing surgical planning and early complication detection. Combined with D-US, it improves perforator selection and perfusion assessment. Thermographic parameters, systemic factors, and flap design metrics collectively predict flap viability.

        "Abstract":"<i>Background and Objectives<\/i>: The management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) extends beyond glycemic control, requiring a more global strategy that includes optimization of body composition, even more so in the context of sarcopenia and visceral adiposity, as they contribute to poor outcomes. Past reviews have typically been focused on weight reduction or glycemic effectiveness, with limited inclusion of new therapies' effects on muscle and fat distribution. In addition, the emergence of incretin-based therapies and dual agonists such as tirzepatide requires an updated synthesis of their impacts on body composition. This review attempts to bridge the gap by taking a systematic approach to how current blood-glucose lowering therapies affect lean body mass, fat mass, and the risk of sarcopenia in T2D patients. <i>Materials and Methods<\/i>: Between January 2015 and March 2025, we conducted a narrative review by searching the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for English-language articles. The keywords were combinations of the following: \"type 2 diabetes,\" \"lean body mass,\" \"fat mass,\" \"body composition,\" \"sarcopenia,\" \"GLP-1 receptor agonists,\" \"SGLT2 inhibitors,\" \"tirzepatide,\" and \"antidiabetic pharmacotherapy.\" Reference lists were searched manually as well. The highest precedence was assigned to studies that aimed at adult type 2 diabetic subjects and reported body composition results. Inclusion criteria for studies were: (1) type 2 diabetic mellitus adult patients and (2) reporting measures of body composition (e.g., lean body mass, fat mass, or muscle function). We prioritized randomized controlled trials and large observational studies and excluded mixed diabetic populations, non-pharmacological interventions only, and poor reporting of body composition. <i>Results<\/i>: Metformin was widely found to be weight-neutral with minimal effects on muscle mass. Insulin therapy, being an anabolic hormone, often leads to fat mass accumulation and increases the risk of sarcopenic obesity. Incretin-based therapies induced substantial weight loss, mostly from fat mass. Notable results were observed in studies with tirzepatide, demonstrating superior reduction not only in fat mass, but also in visceral fat. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) promote fat loss but are associated with a small yet significant decrease in lean muscle mass. <i>Conclusions<\/i>: Blood-glucose lowering therapies demonstrated clinically relevant effects on body composition. Treatment should be personalized, balancing glycemic control, cardiovascular, and renal benefits, together with optimal impact on muscle mass along with glycemic, cardiovascular, and renal benefits."

        "Abstract":"<i>Background and Objectives:<\/i> Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are closely linked and associated with a higher risk of complications. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide in achieving a composite endpoint of A1C and weight reduction. <i>Materials and Methods:<\/i> This retrospective cohort study assessed the effectiveness of semaglutide in obese patients with T2D at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. This study included patients who received semaglutide treatment for 12 months, and the endpoint was reducing A1C by \u2265 1% and body weight by \u2265 5% after 12 months of starting semaglutide. Secondary endpoints include predictors of achieving the composite endpoint and the effect on the lipid profile. <i>Results:<\/i> The present study enrolled 459 participants, with dyslipidemia and hypertension being the most common comorbidities. After 12 months of treatment with semaglutide, 42% of the patients achieved the composite endpoint. Semaglutide significantly reduced weight, BMI, A1C, FBG, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. The subgroup analysis showed that patients who achieved the composite endpoint were younger and had significantly lower use of insulin. Females in the study had significantly higher BMI, A1C, and HDL levels and lower levels of triglycerides compared to males. Multivariate analysis revealed that baseline BMI (aOR = 0.953; 95% CI: 0.915 to 0.992; <i>p<\/i> = 0.02), baseline A1C (aOR = 1.213; 95% CI: 1.062 to 1.385; <i>p<\/i> = 0.004), and receiving insulin (aOR = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.343; <i>p<\/i> = 0.007) were significant predictors of composite endpoint achievement. <i>Conclusions:<\/i> Semaglutide is a valuable option for the treatment of obese patients with T2D. This study found that semaglutide is effective in reducing weight and A1C and improving the lipid profile. The predictors of achievement of the composite endpoint were lower baseline BMI, higher baseline A1C, and insulin non-use."

The data included fasting blood glucose, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores. <i>Results<\/i>: Moderate positive correlations were observed between depression scores and blood glucose (r = 0.44) and between alcohol consumption and blood glucose (r = 0.43). The interaction term (BDI \u00d7 AUDIT) was statistically significant in multiple regression (\u03b2 = 0.012, <i>p<\/i> = 0.001), and the model explained 39.1% of glucose variability. Logistic regression analysis revealed that neither high alcohol consumption (OR = 1.38, <i>p<\/i> = 0.441) nor severe depression alone (OR = 1.30, <i>p<\/i> = 0.582) were significantly associated with hyperglycemia. However, their interaction demonstrated a strong and statistically significant effect (OR = 19.3, 95% CI: 3.22-115.81, <i>p<\/i> = 0.001). The prevalence of hyperglycemia reached 95.8% in patients with both risk factors. <i>Conclusions<\/i>: The combined presence of high alcohol consumption and severe depression significantly increases the risk of hyperglycemia.

Mounting evidence suggests that sex indeed could play some distinct role in shaping the incidence, outcomes, and treatment of IS. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, contradictory findings from previous studies that also addressed sex differences in cerebrovascular diseases demonstrate the need for further focused research. This study aimed to evaluate the sex discrepancies in the clinical presentation of IS and its outcomes in patients admitted to Kaunas Hospital of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LUHS), Lithuania. <i>Materials and Methods<\/i>: This is a retrospective record-based single-center study. All the study patients-727 men and 1082 women-enrolled between 1 January 2020, and 27 February 2022; suffered from acute IS; and had absolute contraindications against interventional IS treatment. These patients received a conservative non-interventional IS treatment at the neurological department of the LUHS's Kaunas Hospital. The sociodemographic data; laboratory findings; comorbidities, including COVID-19; in-hospital complications; and outcome factors were obtained from the patients' medical records and evaluated by deploying appropriate statistical tests. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by the Cox proportional hazards regression for in-hospital lethality. <i>Results<\/i>: The mean age of IS patients was significantly higher in women compared to men (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001), as was the proportion of in-hospital deaths (19.10% and 15.36%, respectively; <i>p<\/i> < 0.05). The mean total number of in-hospital complications was again significantly higher in the group of women compared to men (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). The prevalence of COVID-19 was higher in men compared to women (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). COVID-19 diagnosis (HR = 1.53; <i>p<\/i> = 0.02) and acute in-hospital pulmonary complications (HR = 1.91; <i>p<\/i> = 0.008) significantly increased the risk of in-hospital lethality in men. The risk of in-hospital lethality was significantly higher in women with comorbid diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) compared to those with comorbid isolated arterial hypertension (AH) (HR = 2.25, <i>p<\/i> = 0.007). Increased C-reactive protein elevated the risk of in-hospital lethality by more than twice in both men and women (HR = 2.46; <i>p<\/i> < 0.001 and HR = 2.28; <i>p<\/i> < 0.001, respectively). <i>Conclusions<\/i>: The following differences between men and women with IS were determined: Acute in-hospital pulmonary complications, including COVID-19, significantly increased the risk of in-hospital lethality in the male group, but not in women. However, women suffering from DM had a significantly increased risk of in-hospital lethality compared with those women IS patients with AH or chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD). Increased C-reactive protein was associated with an elevated risk of in-hospital lethality both in male and female groups."

This study investigated the potential influence of DM on perioperative outcomes following SSRF, using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). <i>Materials and Methods:<\/i> Data of 1603 patients with multiple rib fractures who underwent SSRF between 2001 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into three groups: no DM, DM without chronic complications, and DM with chronic complications. The associations between DM status and perioperative outcomes, including hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, readmission rates, and complications such as pneumonia, surgical site infection (SSI), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and total hospital costs were determined using univariate and multivariable regression analyses. <i>Results:<\/i> The mean age of the 1603 patients was 52.0 years, and 71% were male. Patients with DM and chronic complications had higher risks of 14-day readmission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-7.62), 15-30 day readmission (aOR = 3.28; 95% CI: 1.25-8.60), SSI (aOR = 2.90; 95% CI: 1.37-6.14), AMI (aOR = 3.44; 95% CI: 1.28-9.24), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.03-3.74). In conclusion, DM, particularly DM with chronic complications, significantly increases the risk of adverse short-term outcomes following SSRF. <i>Conclusions:<\/i> These findings emphasize the need for enhanced care for patients with DM to optimize the outcomes of SSRF."

Vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as a potential contributing factor to vascular disease; however, its impact on early cardiac changes associated with T2DM remains poorly understood. Our aim was to evaluate the association between serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], arterial stiffness, and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) in patients with T2DM who do not have a clinically evident cardiovascular disease. <i>Material and methods:<\/i> This cross-sectional study evaluated the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVao), LV GLS, and serum 25(OH)D3 levels in patients diagnosed with T2DM (<i>n<\/i> = 65) compared to healthy control subjects (<i>n<\/i> = 55). Independent predictors of arterial stiffness were identified by a multivariate logistic regression analysis. <i>Results:<\/i> Patients with T2DM showed a significant increase in IMT and PWVao, a reduction in LV GLS, and low levels of 25(OH)D3 compared to subjects in the control group (all <i>p<\/i> < 0.05). Both vitamin D deficiency and T2DM were found to be independently associated with an increased arterial stiffness, with odds ratios of 2.4 and 4.8, respectively. A significant inverse relationship was identified between 25(OH)D3 levels and markers of arterial stiffness, as well as LV GLS, suggesting a possible association between the vitamin D status and the early onset of cardiovascular dysfunction. <i>Conclusions:<\/i> Patients with T2DM show early signs of heart and blood vessel problems, even with an ejection fraction that remains within normal limits. There is a significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and increased arterial stiffness, along with impaired LV GLS, indicating its possible involvement in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes. These findings support the utility of integrating vascular, myocardial, and vitamin D assessments in early cardiovascular risk stratification for T2DM patients."

While surgical techniques and immunosuppressive strategies have advanced considerably, graft rejection and limited long-term graft survival remain significant clinical challenges. <b>Method:<\/b> To better understand these risks, the genetic and immunological factors that influence transplant outcomes are examined. Beyond traditional human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, non-HLA genetic variants such as gene deletions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have emerged as contributors to alloimmune activation and graft failure. <b>Result:<\/b> Polymorphisms in cytokine genes, minor histocompatibility antigens, and immune-regulatory pathways have been implicated in transplant outcomes. However, the integration of such genomic data into clinical practice remains limited due to underexplored gene targets, variability in study results, and the lack of large, diverse, and well-characterized patient cohorts. Initiatives like the International Genetics & Translational Research in Transplantation Network (iGeneTRAiN) are addressing these limitations by aggregating genome-wide data from thousands of transplant donors and recipients across multiple centers.

However, adolescents experience health benefits when these behaviours are balanced appropriately throughout the day, and are considered to be interconnected rather than isolated. The aim of this study was to investigate the perspectives of adolescents living with T1D towards these behaviours collectively. The participants were 15 adolescents (aged 11-18 years) with T1D, recruited using online methods and word of mouth. Online semi-structured interviews were transcribed using intelligent verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. We identified the following four central themes and five subthemes: (1) sleep and physical activity are understood and valued above sedentary behaviour; (2) recognition of movement behaviours' interconnection; (3) movement behaviours' interaction with health outcomes (mood, glycaemic control, and glycaemic control as a barrier to movement behaviours); and (4) movement behaviours within the environmental context of the adolescent (school and caregivers). Adolescents with T1D are aware of the interconnectedness of each movement behaviour and the positive influence a balanced approach can have on mood and T1D management.

This study aimed to assess the association between ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption, as defined by the NOVA classification, and metabolic parameters in T2DM patients. This was a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from the NUGLIC study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Multiple linear and Poisson regressions were used to evaluate associations between quintiles of processed and ultra-processed food consumption and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included fasting glucose, lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference. This study included 326 participants. UPF consumption accounted for approximately 16.4% of total daily energy intake. No significant linear associations were observed between higher consumption of industrialized foods and anthropometric or glycemic markers. However, intermediate and high consumption levels were associated with an increased total cholesterol (Q3: \u03b2 = 26.6; Q4: \u03b2 = 26.7) and LDL-cholesterol (Q4: \u03b2 = 19.8; Q5: \u03b2 = 17.5).

Standardized SNA was conducted to collect information on financial needs, psychosocial well-being, and other chronic health conditions. Based on their identified needs, participants were referred to non-medical existing community resources. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with a subset of participants. A team member independently categorized these SNA narratives and aggregated them into two overarching groups: medical and social needs. Fifty-nine participants (with a mean age of 53 years and equal representation of men and women) completed an SNA. Most (71%) did not have health insurance. Among 12 potential social needs surveyed, the most frequently requested resources were occupational therapy (78%), utility assistance (73%), and food pantry services (71%). SNA provided data with the potential to address barriers that may hinder participation, retention, and outcomes in diabetes self-management. SNA findings may serve as tertiary prevention to mitigate diabetes-related complications and disparities."

        "Abstract":"There is little qualitative research on the support needed by workers with type 1 diabetes to effectively self-manage at work and maintain work ability. In this UK study, 21 workers with type 1 diabetes participated in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis and then characterised under the Psychosocial Flags Framework. Findings highlighted several obstacles to maintaining self-management, including systemic workplace issues (black flags), individual attitudes and beliefs (yellow flags), and workplace issues (blue flags). Participants generally lacked confidence in voicing their needs, emphasising a requirement for a more supportive, inclusive workplace culture. This indicates a need for employers to foster an environment where workers with T1D feel comfortable seeking support without penalty. Addressing unhelpful perceptions of T1D seems key to this, making increased knowledge and awareness crucial for the harmonious integration of T1D with work. But delivering effective interventions may be challenging, since they must account for the complex biopsychosocial interplay of obstacles to work ability that this qualitative investigation emphasises."

        "Abstract":"<b>Background\/Objectives:<\/b> Patients with diabetes mellitus face increased risk of severe outcomes and mortality from COVID-19. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, widely used antidiabetic agents, are hypothesized to affect COVID-19 outcomes via anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating mechanisms. However, real-world evidence, especially in Korean populations, remains limited. <b>Methods:<\/b> We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Korea's nationwide Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) database. Adults with diabetes hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March 2021, and 28 February 2022, were included and stratified by DPP-4 inhibitor use. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities estimated hazard ratios (HRs). Subgroup analyses examined angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and insulin use. <b>Results:<\/b> Among 16,134 eligible patients, 7082 received DPP-4 inhibitors. The 30-day mortality rate was lower in DPP-4 inhibitor users than non-users (4.3% vs. 10.3%, <i>p<\/i> < 0.0001). Adjusted analyses showed DPP-4 inhibitor use was associated with reduced mortality risk (adjusted HR: 0.455; 95% CI: 0.414-0.499). Subgroup analyses yielded consistent results across ARB and insulin users. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated higher survival probability in the DPP-4 inhibitor group. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> In this nationwide Korean cohort, DPP-4 inhibitor use was associated with lower mortality among hospitalized diabetic patients with COVID-19. While these findings suggest a potential benefit, causality cannot be confirmed due to the observational design. Prospective studies are needed to verify these associations and explore underlying mechanisms."

Despite decades of research, the achievement of durable immune tolerance remains elusive. This review presents a historically grounded and forward-looking perspective on the evolution of immunotherapy in T1DM, from early immunosuppressive interventions to advanced precision-based cellular approaches. Specifically, we focus on systemic immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-CD3, anti-IL-1, anti-TNF), regulatory cell-based approaches (e.g., Tregs, CAR-Tregs, MDSCs), and \u03b2-cell replacement strategies using stem cell-derived islets. <b>Methods:<\/b> We analyzed major clinical and translational milestones in immunotherapy for T1DM, with particular attention to the transition from broad immunosuppression to targeted modulation of immune pathways. Emerging data on cell-based therapies, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven stratification, and personalized intervention timing have been incorporated to provide a comprehensive overview of current and future directions. <b>Results:<\/b> Initial therapies such as corticosteroids and cyclosporine offered proof-of-concept for immune modulation, yet suffered from relapse and toxicity. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (e.g., teplizumab) marked a shift toward immune-specific intervention, particularly in stage 2 preclinical T1DM. More recent approaches include low-dose IL-2, checkpoint modulation, and antigen-specific tolerance strategies. Cellular therapies such as Treg adoptive transfer, chimeric antigen receptor Tregs (CAR-Tregs), and stem cell-derived islet replacements (e.g., VX-880) have shown promise in preserving \u03b2-cell function and modulating autoimmunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), although still preclinical, represent a complementary avenue for immune tolerance induction. Concurrently, AI-based models are emerging as tools to stratify risk and personalize immunotherapeutic timing, enhancing trial design and outcome prediction. <b>Conclusions<\/b>: In conclusion, the historical progression from broad immunosuppression to precision-driven strategies underscores the importance of stage-specific, mechanism-based interventions in T1DM. The convergence of targeted biologics, regenerative cell therapies, and \u03b2-cell replacement approaches, supported by AI-enabled patient stratification, offers a realistic path toward durable immune tolerance and functional \u03b2-cell preservation. Continued integration of these modalities, coupled with rigorous long-term evaluation, will be essential to transform these scientific advances into sustained clinical benefit."

        "Abstract":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies. While PD is most recognized by its motor symptoms (resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability), cognitive decline (CD) may become apparent as PD progresses, leading to Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance (IR) are risk factors for dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease; however, their influence on dementia in PD is underexplored. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of T2DM and IR on dementia in PD. A systematic search of articles from 2005 to March 2025 was undertaken using Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and citation searching. Case-control, cross-sectional, longitudinal, and non-human population studies assessing cognitive outcomes in individuals with PD, with and without T2DM and IR, were included (PROSPERO registration number CRD420251013367). In total, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, with clinical sample sizes ranging from 23 to 544,162 participants. Among the 23 clinical studies, 15 identified T2DM as a contributor to cognitive decline (CD) in PD, and 4 specifically examined insulin resistance (IR). Elevated HbA1c was consistently associated with poorer cognitive performance and increased risk of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD); HbA1c \u2265 7% independently predicted cognitive impairment (OR = 4.25, 95% CI: 1.59-11.34). Vascular and inflammatory markers, including elevated LDL-C, fibrinogen, and hs-CRP, further exacerbated CD. MoCA and MMSE scores were the most common cognitive measures, consistently showing worse outcomes in PD patients with T2DM. Preclinical studies supported these associations, showing that high-fat-diet-induced T2DM and IR aggravated dopaminergic neuronal loss by 38-45%, increased \u03b1-synuclein by 35%, and heightened microglial activation, providing mechanistic evidence for the observed clinical associations. This systematic review, the first to examine the impact of T2DM and IRs on the occurrence and advancement of CD in PD patients, demonstrates a possible association between the two. However, these results demonstrate the need for larger sample sizes and the inclusion of additional clinical variables, such as HbA1c levels and pharmacological interventions, providing further information about the link between metabolic dysfunction and CD in PD. To further strengthen this link, longitudinal studies with systematic follow-ups are essential to establish causal links and avoid misdiagnosis in clinical practice."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes is increasingly recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease marked by systemic metabolic disturbances, with endothelial dysfunction playing a central role in its complications. Hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes, drives endothelial damage by inducing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, particularly hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>). This oxidative stress impairs endothelial cells, which are vital for vascular health, leading to severe complications such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and coronary artery disease-major causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Recent studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs), in mitigating these complications. pMSCs exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and tissue-repair properties, showing promise in reversing endothelial damage in laboratory settings. To explore their efficacy in a more physiologically relevant context, we used a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model, which mimics type 1 diabetes by destroying pancreatic beta cells and causing hyperglycemia. pMSCs were administered via intra-peritoneal injections, and their effects on endothelial injury and tissue damage were assessed. Metabolic tests, including glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) revealed that pMSCs did not restore metabolic homeostasis or improve glucose regulation. However, histopathological kidney, heart, and eye tissue analyses demonstrated significant protective effects. pMSCs preserved glomerular structure in the kidneys, protected cardiac blood vessels, and maintained retinal integrity, suggesting their potential to address diabetes-related tissue injuries. Although these findings underscore the therapeutic potential of pMSCs for diabetic complications, further research is needed to optimize dosing, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and evaluate long-term safety and efficacy. Combining pMSCs with other therapies may enhance their benefits, paving the way for future clinical applications."

In recent years, increasing evidence has highlighted its involvement in chronic diseases, particularly metabolic disorders and cancer. PXR modulates drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, inflammatory factors, lipid metabolism, and immune-related pathways, contributing to the maintenance of hepatic-intestinal barrier homeostasis, energy metabolism, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), PXR influences disease progression by regulating glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In obesity, it affects adipogenesis and inflammatory processes. In atherosclerosis (AS), PXR exerts protective effects through cholesterol metabolism and anti-inflammatory actions. In metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), it is closely associated with lipid synthesis, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota balance. Moreover, PXR plays dual roles in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Currently, PXR-targeted strategies, such as small molecule agonists and antagonists, represent promising therapeutic avenues for treating metabolic diseases and cancer. This review comprehensively summarizes the structural features, signaling pathways, and gene regulatory functions of PXR, as well as its role in metabolic diseases and cancer, providing insights into its therapeutic potential and future drug development challenges."

        "Abstract":"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are essential for preserving liver homeostasis. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) encompasses a category of hepatic disorders characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, known as steatosis. Over time, accumulated hepatic fat can induce inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). MASLD is among the most prevalent types of chronic liver disease. Obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are frequent etiological factors of MASLD. In the absence of therapy, MASLD can lead to more severe hepatic conditions, which can be life-threatening. MASLD is noteworthy due to its potential progression to MASH and further severe liver impairment, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a neoplastic progression. This narrative review examines the distinctive functions of LSECs in regulating immunologic responses, collagenization, and drug-sensitive bioreactivity in healthy livers, MASLD, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), as well as in a human primary 3D model. We found that LSECs serve as crucial regulators of immunological equilibrium in the liver by inhibiting disproportionate immunologic activation, concurrently filtering tissue antigens, and engaging with immunologic cells, such as Kupffer cells (KCs) and T lymphocytes. In chronic diseases of the liver, LSECs experience cellular dysfunction, resulting in capillarization (focal to diffuse), loss of fenestrations (<i>fenestrae<\/i>), and the activation of pro-fibrotic signaling pathways, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2). Indeed, TGF-\u03b2 is crucial in activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a process that facilitates the progression of liver disease toward fibrosis. In addition to examining the dynamic interplay between LSECs, specifically HSCs, and other liver cells throughout the progression of fatty liver-MASH, we suggest that LSECs may become a potential therapeutic target for modifying immune responses and averting fibrosis in hepatic disorders. The limitations of animal models are also highlighted and discussed."

        "Abstract":"The low predictability of the effects of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in regenerative therapy for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) underscores the need for further research assessing the reparative effects of PRP based on the type of DM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regenerative potential of PRP from young donors (30-40 years old) with DM1 and DM2 in vitro, specifically its effects on human dermal fibroblast cell culture. The in vitro effects of PRP from patients with type 1 and type 2 DM were investigated using a culture of human dermal fibroblasts (hTERT-HDFa) to evaluate metabolic activity, migration, proliferation of the cells, and their ability to release growth factors and exosomes. The study of the biological effects of PRP from donors with DM on hTERT-HDFa revealed a decrease in proliferative effects, an increase in prooxidant action, and toxic influences of PRP from patients, characterized by reduced metabolic activity and cell viability in culture, along with an increase in the percentage of necrosis. These effects were most pronounced in type 1 DM. The secretory response of hTERT-HDFa upon stimulation with PRP varied depending on the type of DM. Correlations indicated the differing significance of PAI-1, TGFB-1, PDGF, VEGF, and IL-6 in assessing the reparative potential across different types of DM."

        "Abstract":"Although the <i>MTNR1B<\/i> single nucleotide polymorphism rs10830963 has been strongly associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D), its association with the progression and prognosis of T2D has been understudied. We conducted this prospective analysis based on the UK Biobank cohort study. Microvascular complications (MIC) of T2D in this study included diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic kidney disease. Macrovascular complications (MAC) of T2D included diabetic coronary artery disease, diabetic cerebrovascular disease, and diabetic peripheral vascular disease. The multi-state model was used to analyze the association between the polymorphism of rs10830963 and the trajectory of T2D. The accelerated failure time (AFT) model was used to assess the association between rs10830963 and the onset of T2D and T2D comorbidities. A total of 283,531 middle- and old-age participants were included. During a median follow-up of 13.7 years, 11,947 participants developed T2D, 1556 participants developed MIC, 1797 participants developed MAC, and 618 participants died. In the additive model, the G risk allele of rs10830963 was significantly associated with an increased risk of the transition from T2D-free to T2D (HR = 1.050, 95% CI: 1.020, 1.079) and a decreased risk of the transition from T2D to MIC (HR = 0.918, 95% CI: 0.850, 0.992), particularly from T2D to diabetic retinopathy (HR = 0.882, 95% CI: 0.782, 0.995). Besides, the G risk allele of rs10830963 accelerated the transition from T2D-free to T2D (Time Ratio [TR] = 0.966, 95% CI: 0.947, 0.986) and slowed down the transition from T2D to MIC (TR = 1.067, 95% CI: 1.030, 1.105). The <i>MTNR1B<\/i> single nucleotide polymorphism rs10830963 was associated with an increased risk of T2D and a decreased risk of MIC, particularly diabetic retinopathy among T2D individuals. Our results highlight that rs10830963 might play differential roles in the onset and progression of T2D."

        "Abstract":"Prediabetes and early type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are increasingly recognized as states of both metabolic and neurochemical dysregulation. This narrative review synthesizes emerging evidence of alterations in key neurotransmitter systems-dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate-in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. Beyond peripheral insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction, disturbances in the central nervous system, especially related to neurotransmitter signaling, may play a role in disease onset and progression. Neuroimaging studies reveal early imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, while biochemical and histological findings demonstrate altered receptor expression in both the brain and pancreatic islets. These changes affect metabolic control and are implicated in mood, cognition, and feeding behavior. We investigate the mechanistic links between neurotransmitter dysfunction and glucose metabolism, including the roles of brain insulin resistance, inflammation, mitochondrial stress, and gut-brain axis signaling. Finally, we discuss therapeutic strategies that target neurochemical pathways and highlight the need for longitudinal, sex-aware, and multi-omics studies to refine early interventions. Understanding the neurobiological roots of early T2D could revolutionize risk assessment and open doors for new neuro-metabolic treatments."

        "Abstract":"Thirst is usually characterized as an unpleasant sensation provoking drinking of water. The purpose of the present review is to draw attention to the importance of thirst in overall regulation of body fluid homeostasis in health and pathology. Intensity of thirst is determined by signals generated in multiple groups of osmosensitive neurons engaged in dipsogenic and antidipsogenic activities, which are located in the brain cortex, the insula, the amygdala, the median preoptic area, the hypothalamic nuclei and the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis. Water ingestion is also influenced by signals generated in the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, the pancreas, the liver and the kidney and by changes of body temperature. Regulation of thirst engages the autonomic nervous system and several neuroactive factors synthetized in the brain and the peripheral organs. Among them are components of the renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide, cholecystokinin, ghrelin, gaseous transmitters, cytokines and prostaglandins. Experimental studies provide evidence that elevation of fluid osmolality, which is the most frequent cause of thirst, influences function of the voltage-gated sodium channel and calcium-dependent kinase II subunit alpha. Regulation of thirst may be inappropriate in old age and under some pathological conditions including infections, heart failure, diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, and psychogenic disorders. The molecular background of the abnormal regulation of thirst in the clinical disorders is not yet sufficiently recognized and requires further examination."

        "Abstract":"Early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely associated with vascular remodeling and coronary artery calcification. The aim of this study is to determine whether adropin is associated with asymptomatic coronary calcification in patients in the early stages of CKD. This study enrolled 337 individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the early stages of CKD (G1-2, A1-3) and divided them into two subgroups with (<i>n<\/i> = 196) and without (<i>n<\/i> = 141) asymptomatic coronary artery calcification. Native coronary multi-detector computed tomography angiography was conducted to determine coronary artery calcification, which was stratified into four grades according to the Agatston method. Serum levels of adropin were measured by ELISA. The patients with known asymptomatic coronary artery calcification had significantly lower levels of adropin than those without this condition. The levels of adropin in individuals with mild (130-199 HU), moderate (200-299 HU), severe (300-399 HU) and very severe (\u2265400 HU) calcification were 3.13 (95% CI = 1.92-4.21) ng\/mL, 2.3 (95% CI = 1.45-3.6) ng\/mL, 2.1 (95% CI = 1.22-3.25) ng\/mL and 1.26 (95% CI = 1.13-1.98) ng\/mL, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression low adropin (<2.95 ng\/mL), a presence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exerted their independent potencies to predict asymptomatic coronary calcification. Moreover, adropin demonstrated better discriminative potency than concomitant hypertension and T2DM. Conclusions: Low levels of circulating adropin significantly predicted a risk of coronary artery calcification in patients in the early stages of CKD."

        "Abstract":"Studies utilizing cell-based systems to investigate plant-based diets for diabetes management are gaining attention due to the adverse effects associated with commercially available drugs. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of specific plant-derived products remain inadequately explored. The major aim of our study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which bioactive compounds in the fruit of <i>Solanum<\/i> spp. influence key proteins associated with type 2 diabetes. The expressions of genes such as glucose transporter protein 4 (<i>GLUT4<\/i>), myocyte enhancer factor-2 (<i>MEF-2A<\/i>), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (<i>NRF-1<\/i>) were investigated in a palmitate-induced C2C12 cell model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The structures of these proteins were retrieved from the protein database, while bioactive compounds previously identified in <i>Solanum<\/i> spp. were obtained from PubChem site. Drug-likeness properties of these compounds (ligands) were assessed. The docked protein-ligand complexes were further analyzed using the Protein-Ligand Profiler web server. Our results showed that the studied compounds from <i>Solanum<\/i> spp. profoundly upregulated <i>GLUT4<\/i> expression (9-19-fold increase) in the C2C12 cell line, thus surpassing the effects of the standard anti-diabetic drug metformin. Additionally, activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase were elevated. Molecular docking showed that rutin, an abundant flavonoid from <i>Solanum<\/i> spp., had the highest binding affinity for the active sites of the target proteins. These findings provide new mechanistic insight into the anti-diabetic effects of <i>Solanum<\/i> spp., primarily due to its high rutin content, which plays a major role in the plant's glucose-regulating and antioxidant actions. Our findings underscore the potential use of <i>Solanum<\/i> spp. as an affordable functional food for managing type 2 diabetes, especially in developing countries with limited resources for purchasing drugs. Although promising, our findings should be further validated by clinical studies."

This study assessed the association between serum Gal-3, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and colorectal polyps (CRPs). In this cross-sectional study, 80 non-cancer patients undergoing colonoscopy were divided into four subgroups based on T2D and CRP status. Serum Gal-3 and metabolic parameters were measured. All patients' mean serum Gal-3 level was 13.63 ng\/mL. Gal-3 levels were significantly higher in T2D+ than in the T2D- group (14.93 ng\/mL, <i>p<\/i> = 0.02). Gal-3 concentration correlated significantly with age (rho = 0.281; <i>p<\/i> = 0.012), gender (rho = 0.220; <i>p<\/i> = 0.049), serum peptide C levels (rho = 0.957; <i>p<\/i> = 0.006), and serum IGF-1 levels (rho = -0.417; <i>p<\/i> < 0.001) in all patients, and for patients T2D-, it also correlated significantly with fasting plasma glucose levels (rho = -0.406; <i>p<\/i> = 0.009). A logistic regression analysis of the risk of polyps was conducted (CRP+ vs. CRP-) considering factors such as gender, age, body weight, waist circumference, T2D, HOMA-IR, insulin, API, IGF-1, total cholesterol, and Gal-3. Gal-3 serum was shown to be a strong independent predictor of CRPs regardless of the presence of T2D+ (<i>p<\/i> = 0.031). Gal-3 may correlate with the development of CRPs and might be a candidate biomarker of CRPs\/cancer development."

This study aimed to investigate the global gene expression in four postpartum women with previous GDM (pGDM), three with T2D, and three with a history of normoglycemic pregnancy (controls). Total RNA was extracted from whole blood between March and May 2020. Global mRNA expression was determined using an Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array. The expression of the selected focused genes was validated by RT-PCR. The microarray revealed 140 transcripts (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05, fold change cut-off \u2265 2) in patients with pGDM compared to controls. We identified 583 gene-altered transcripts between patients with T2D and controls. Interestingly, 60 transcripts had genes shared by pGDM or T2D versus the controls. The selected upregulated genes involved in inflammatory response, glycosylation, and death-like domains, according to the functional network analysis of pGDM (<i>TNFAIP6<\/i>, <i>PDK3<\/i>) and T2D (<i>MMP9<\/i> and <i>CARD6<\/i>), showed similar trends to those obtained via microarray. Thus, these differentially expressed genes and their corresponding network and pathway analyses in women with pGDM and T2D offer valuable insights into the possible biological mechanisms of the progression of GDM to T2D."

Twenty-eight male Wistar rats, aged 6 months, 350-400 g, were randomized into four groups. The first group, G-I, the denominated control, were fed standard chow over the whole course of the experiments. The rodents in G-II were exposed to a High-Fat Diet. The last two groups were exposed to Streptozotocin peritoneal injection (35 mg\/kg of body weight). A short biochemical assessment was performed before diabetes model induction to ensure appropriate glucose metabolism before experiments. Following model induction, only rodents in group G-IV were gradually introduced to the same High-Fat Diet as received by G-II. Model confirmation 10 days after injections marked the start of statin treatment in group G-IV, by daily gavage of atorvastatin 20 mg\/kg of body weight\/day for 21 days. At the end of the experiments, the biochemical profile of interest comprised typical renal retention byproducts (urea and creatinine) and the inflammatory profile described using plasma levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-17\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. Treatment with Atorvastatin was associated with a statistically significant improvement in renal function in G-IV compared to untreated diabetic rodents in G-III. Changes in inflammatory activity showed partial association with statin therapy, TNF\u03b1 and IL-17\u03b1 mirroring the trend in urea and creatinine values. Our results indicate that atorvastatin treatment yields a myriad of pleiotropic activities, among which renal protection was clearly demonstrated in this model of diabetic-and-obese rodents. The statin impact on inflammation regulation may not be as clear-cut, but the potential synergy of renal function preservation and partial tapering of inflammatory activity requires further research in severely metabolically challenged models."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a growing global health concern, closely linked to modifiable lifestyle factors. Emerging evidence suggests that religious principles can shape behaviors that promote physical and mental well-being. This study explores how adherence to a lifestyle rooted in Seventh-Day Adventist beliefs may influence the risk of developing T2DM. This study is of a non-experimental quantitative design with a cross-sectional and explanatory scope. The sample consisted of 303 participants (adults who had been active Seventh-Day Adventist Church, SDA, members for the past 3 years), selected by non-probabilistic convenience sampling. Data were collected using the Adventist Lifestyle questionnaire (eight dimensions) and the FINDRISC scale. The non-parametric statistics, Rho Spearman, and ordinal logistic regression analysis were used. The results showed that lifestyle levels based on religious principles significantly predicted the risk of developing T2DM (X<sup>2<\/sup> = 100.34, <i>p<\/i> < 0.05). The model explained approximately 31% of the variance in T2DM risk (R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.31), indicating a moderate association between lifestyle and risk. Specifically, individuals with lower (less healthy) lifestyle scores had a significantly higher likelihood of being classified in higher risk categories for T2DM. It was also observed that there is a significant relationship between the risk of developing T2DM and the following dimensions: Rest (rho = -0.16, <i>p<\/i> < 0.05), exercise (rho = -0.13, <i>p<\/i> < 0.05), temperance (rho = -0.19, <i>p<\/i> < 0.05), nutrition (rho = -0.66, <i>p<\/i> < 0.05) and spirituality (rho = -0.57, <i>p<\/i> < 0.05). A healthier lifestyle promoted by religious principles, such as the SDA, reduces the risk of developing T2DM. A stronger correlation was perceived between nutrition and spirituality since these practices are related to a low risk of developing the disease."

        "Abstract":"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are becoming an increasingly utilised alternative to traditional central venous access devices. Their uptake, particularly among oncology patients, is due to their growing ease of access, suitability for medium-term use and perceived safety profile. However, PICCs can be a source of severe and life-threatening complications such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), malpositioning, dislodgement, and occlusion. This narrative was constructed from a literature review of the PubMed database, utilising MESH terms for peripherally inserted central catheters, percutaneous central catheters, PICC, and complications. Randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published between 2015 and 2025 were included. Additional articles were obtained through targeted PubMed searches or from references within previous articles. Major periprocedural complications were seen in 1.1% of PICC insertions, CLABSI in 1.4-1.9%, venous thrombosis embolism (including PE) in 2.3-5.9%, and malpositioning in 7.87%. The overall PICC complication incidence was 9.5-38.6%, which is greater than that of centrally inserted central venous access. A higher BMI, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and malignancy were the most significant predictive factors for PICC-associated complications. PICC complications are common, occurring more frequently than other forms of central venous access, and may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Appropriate assessment of patient risk factors and optimisation strategies may reduce complication rates."

However, few assessment tools have been employed to evaluate long-term knowledge retention among T1D patients years after diagnosis. We developed a 20-question test to assess the knowledge of patients and their families at the conclusion of the initial education process and again 6-12 months later. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. Statistical analyses included comparisons between the first and second test results, as well as evaluation of potential contributing factors. The internal consistency and construct validity of the questionnaire were evaluated. Forty-four patients completed both assessments, with a median interval of 11.5 months between them. The average score on the first test was 88.6, which declined to 82.7 on the second assessment (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001). In univariate analysis, factors positively associated with higher scores included Jewish ethnicity, lower HbA1c levels, and shorter hospitalization duration. Multivariate analysis revealed that parents had lower odds of experiencing a significant score decline compared to patients. Cronbach's alpha was 0.69, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified eight components accounting for 67.1% of the total variance. Healthcare providers should consider offering re-education to patients and their families approximately one year after diagnosis, with particular attention to high-risk populations during the initial education phase. Further studies are needed to examine this tool's performance in larger cohorts."

        "Abstract":"Maternal health has a profound impact on fetal development, influencing the risk of pediatric endocrine disorders both directly and indirectly through various biological and environmental mechanisms. Throughout pregnancy, several endocrine disorders can arise or be exacerbated due to the physiological changes that occur. An in-depth review of articles with evidence-based research discussing the significant effects of maternal endocrinopathies and endocrine disruptors on fetal development and infant health was conducted in this review paper. The most common endocrine disorder during pregnancy is gestational diabetes mellitus, which has an incidence rate of 2-16%, depending on ethnic origin. Maternal diabetes, apart from macrosomia and hypoglycemia, increases the risk for several pregnancy and neonatal complications such as stillbirth, perinatal mortality, and congenital malformations. Other endocrine issues occurring in pregnancy include alterations in thyroid hormone levels, obesity-related insulin resistance, Cushing syndrome, or polycystic ovarian syndrome, which all may negatively influence the fetus, as well as offspring development. Additionally, environmental exposure to harmful substances during pregnancy can disrupt endocrine function. Bisphenol A is the most common endocrine disruptor, which is particularly detrimental during gestation. Bisphenol A exposure is related to low birth weight, preterm birth, or developmental delays. Also, its exposition could be associated with an increased risk of obesity, metabolic disorders, and certain cancers later in life. Endocrinopathies and exposure to endocrine disruptors during pregnancy represent a challenging problem, being widespread and demanding appropriate management to reduce fetal and newborn complications."

These conditions altogether accelerate adverse outcomes when they coexist. Recent evidence has shown that the function of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) alleviate stress on multiple organs. SGLT2i has been demonstrated to benefit heart failure, hemodynamic regulation, and renal protection while GLP-1RA on the other hand has been shown to demonstrate a strong impact on glycemic management, weight loss, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review will aim to understand and evaluate the mechanistic rationalization, clinical evidence, and the potential therapeutic treatment of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists to treat individuals who have CKM syndrome. This analysis also assesses whether combination therapy can be a synergistic approach that may benefit patients but is still underutilized because of the lack of clear guidelines, the associated costs, and disparities in accessibility. Therefore, in this review, we will be discussing the combination therapy's additive and synergistic effects, current recommendations and clinical evidence, and mechanistic insights of these GLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in CKM syndrome patients.

Final study inclusion was based on the clinical relevance and agreement between reviewers. <b>Results:<\/b> Current evidence links SH with higher stroke severity (Higher national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS)), larger infarct volumes, increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation, and worse functional recovery (Lower modified rankin scale (mRS)), especially in ischemic stroke. In hemorrhagic stroke, SH is associated with hematoma expansion, perihematomal edema, and worsening neurological function. Although SH has been shown to be a reliable stroke outcome predictor, there is no scientific consensus regarding the most reliable measurement method. The use of absolute blood glucose values may not accurately reflect SH, particularly in diabetic patients, where chronic baseline hyperglycemia complicates interpretation. This underscores the necessity for individualized assessment rather than a uniform interpretation. Clinically, the early detection of SH may provide enhanced monitoring and supportive care; however, rigorous glucose management remains contentious due to the risk of hypoglycemia. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> This review synthesizes evidence from recent studies and supports SH as a prognostic marker of both short- and long-term adverse outcomes in stroke patients. Further research is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of targeted glycemic treatments on such outcomes."

        "Title":"Integrating Regenerative Medicine in Chronic Wound Management: A Single-Center Experience.",
        "Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>: Chronic wounds represent a persistent clinical challenge and impose a considerable burden on healthcare systems. These lesions often require multidisciplinary management due to underlying factors such as microbial colonization, impaired immunity, and vascular insufficiencies. Regenerative therapies, particularly autologous approaches, have emerged as promising strategies to enhance wound healing. Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may improve outcomes through paracrine effects and growth factor release. <b>Methods<\/b>: A prospective observational study was conducted on 31 patients with chronic wounds that were unresponsive to conservative treatment for over six weeks. Clinical and photographic evaluations were employed to monitor healing. All patients underwent surgical debridement, with adjunctive interventions-negative pressure wound therapy, grafting, or flaps-applied as needed. PRP infiltration and\/or autologous adipose tissue transfer were administered based on wound characteristics. Wound area reduction was the primary outcome measure. <b>Results<\/b>: The cohort included 17 males and 14 females (mean age: 59 years). Etiologies included venous insufficiency (39%), diabetes mellitus (25%), arterial insufficiency (16%), and trauma (16%). Most lesions (84%) were located on the lower limbs. All patients received PRP therapy; five underwent combined PRP and fat grafting. Over the study period, 64% of the patients exhibited >80% wound area reduction, with complete healing in 48.3% and a mean healing time of 49 days. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> PRP therapy proved to be a safe, effective, and adaptable treatment, promoting substantial healing in chronic wounds. Autologous adipose tissue transfer did not confer additional benefit. PRP may warrant inclusion in national treatment protocols."

        "Abstract":"<b>Background\/Objectives<\/b>: The role of intestinal dysbiosis as an important driver of inflammation in metabolic disorders is becoming increasingly evident. Beta-defensin 2 is an antimicrobial peptide that contributes to innate immunity, while recently it has been suggested as a novel biomarker of gut dysbiosis. However, its role in obesity remains unexplored. This study aimed to compare circulating beta-defensin 2 levels between individuals with overweight and obesity and lean controls. An additional objective was to explore potential correlations between beta-defensin 2 and other inflammatory markers in this population. <b>Methods<\/b>: The study population consisted of 81 participants (61.7% females) divided into obesity (n = 27), overweight (n = 34), and normal body mass index (n = 20) groups. All participants were free of infection and diabetes mellitus. Beta-defensin 2, interleukin-6, presepsin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and ferritin were evaluated in the study groups. <b>Results<\/b>: We did not find significant differences in beta-defensin 2 levels between the groups (<i>p<\/i> = 0.936). In contrast, hs-CRP levels were higher in people with obesity compared to the sum of participants in the overweight and control groups (<i>p<\/i> = 0.044), after adjusting for the effects of age, sex, smoking, and vitamin D status. Furthermore, a positive correlation was established between beta-defensin 2 and presepsin values (<i>p<\/i> = 0.012). <b>Conclusions<\/b>: The results of the present study demonstrate that obesity is characterized by an aggravation of inflammation, as expressed by elevated hs-CRP levels. Although the study design cannot prove causal relationships, our findings also suggest that beta-defensin 2 levels correlate with the magnitude of systemic inflammation in infection-free individuals living with obesity. The value of the combined evaluation of different biomarkers in obesity-related outcomes warrants further investigation by larger studies."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects 90% of diabetes cases and worsens cardiovascular health by causing oxidative stress, which leads to oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and foam cell formation, contributing to atherosclerosis. This study examined the relationship between <i>CD36<\/i> gene variants, soluble CD36 (sCD36), oxLDL, and MDA-LDL in T2DM and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STE-T2DM) patients in western Mexico. The analysis included 400 T2DM patients, 400 STE-T2DM patients, and 400 healthy controls. Results showed that STE-T2DM patients were older, mainly male, and had higher rates of smoking, sedentarism, and hypertension. Both diabetic groups exhibited elevated triacylglycerols and low HDL, with significantly higher C-reactive protein in STE-T2DM (<i>p<\/i> < 0.0001). No significant differences in <i>CD36<\/i> gene variant frequencies were found, but sCD36 levels were elevated in STE-T2DM, with associations to specific genotypes. oxLDL was higher in STE-T2DM compared to controls (<i>p<\/i> = 0.0268). Binary logistic regression analysis identified male sex, younger age, sedentarism, and rs3173798 T\/T genotype as independent risk factors for myocardial infarction (AUC: 0.9267, <i>p<\/i> < 0.0001). Elevated sCD36 levels may reflect atherosclerosis progression in diabetes, indicating the need for further studies to clarify CD36's role in cardiometabolic dysfunction. These findings highlight CD36's involvement in oxidative stress responses through its interaction with oxLDL and MDA-LDL, suggesting its potential role as a molecular target in antioxidant defense mechanisms."

        "Abstract":"Oxidative stress directly or indirectly contributes to the development and progression of various diseases; therefore, regulating oxidative stress is a promising strategy for preventing or treating these conditions. The unique substances in soybeans, soy isoflavones, notably genistein, which have a strong antioxidant capacity, are considered to regulate various signaling pathways, alleviate oxidative stress, and improve gut microbiota imbalance as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. In this literature review, we summarize the latest research on genistein, providing evidence of its development and application as a potential drug for preventing and treating five selected diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cancers). The literature was searched using keywords that include tripartite combinations of genistein and oxidative stress, along with each of the five selected diseases, from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar between 2014 and 2024. According to current in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials, we comprehensively discuss the therapeutic dose used to target various disease entities to achieve optimal efficacy and meet safety requirements. Moreover, considering the poor water solubility and limited bioavailability of genistein, strategies for improving its therapeutic efficacy, such as combining it with exercise, existing medications, and advanced technologies, as well as applying nanotechnology, were assessed. Therefore, this review aims to provide robust evidence for the development and application of genistein as a potential therapeutic agent or functional food for preventing and treating these diseases."

        "Abstract":"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2<\/sub>S) has been established to regulate mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, but whether the regulation is through <i>S<\/i>-sulfhydration (-SSH) of mitochondrial complexes is not well understood. Recently, H<sub>2<\/sub>S is known to exert diverse and dose-dependent effects on mitochondrial complexes. However, the involvement of <i>S<\/i>-sulfhydration of each mitochondrial complex and the activities in diabetic hearts have not been revealed. Here, we conducted comprehensive investigations into <i>S<\/i>-sulfhydration and the activities of mitochondrial complexes I-V in normal and Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic (DM) heart mitochondria. Results showed that proteins of H<sub>2<\/sub>S-producing enzymes were downregulated in DM heart mitochondria, which was accompanied by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), greater ROS, and lower complex I and V activities, reduced complex V-SSH in DM. In both groups, supplementation with the H<sub>2<\/sub>S donor NaHS increased the <i>S<\/i>-sulfhydration of all mitochondrial complexes, and the activities of complexes I-III and V were significantly increased but complex IV activity was reduced. Consequently, mitochondrial MMP, ROS, and ATP production were normalized with NaHS in DM, whereas inhibition of H<sub>2<\/sub>S generation increased mitochondrial ROS and reduced MMP via reducing complex activities in both groups. Ischemic reperfusion did not affect NaHS-increment of <i>S<\/i>-sulfhydration of complexes I-V, but significantly impaired complex V activity in DM.

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus, as a metabolic disorder, has received growing attention for its detrimental effects on the male reproductive system (particularly the testes) manifesting as increased oxidative stress, reduced blood perfusion, heightened inflammation, and germ cell apoptosis under hyperglycemic conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, a pivotal transcription factor in cellular hypoxia responses, plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Emerging evidence underscores its significant physiological and pathological roles in diabetic testicular injury. This review outlines the structural domains, activation mechanisms, and key target genes of HIF-1\u03b1, and further examines its involvement in diabetes-induced oxidative stress, impaired perfusion, endocrine dysregulation, and the imbalance of apoptosis and autophagy in testicular tissue. Notably, HIF-1\u03b1 exerts protective effects by activating canonical signaling pathways such as phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K)\/protein kinase B (Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, thereby enhancing antioxidant gene expression, promoting angiogenesis, and upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, HIF-1\u03b1 may help stabilize androgen levels by preserving Leydig cell function, potentially alleviating diabetes-associated gonadal dysfunction. This review also discusses the feasibility of targeting HIF-1\u03b1 as a novel therapeutic strategy. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of HIF-1\u03b1's mechanistic role in diabetic testicular damage provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes-related reproductive disorders and offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention."

        "Abstract":"Patients with concurrent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit increased susceptibility to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study investigated the contribution of ketogenesis to T2DM-mediated NAFLD exacerbation and elucidated the therapeutic mechanism of cynaroside in NASH-complicated T2DM. Male C57BL\/6J mice were given CDAHFD combined with streptozotocin to establish stage-specific NAFLD with T2DM models. Hepatic HMGCS2 expression was modulated via tail vein injection of adenoviral vectors for HMGCS2 overexpression or knockdown. Cynaroside was administered orally from week 5 to week 8. The results showed that concurrent T2DM accelerated NAFLD progression, accompanied by a dysregulated ketogenesis that was correlated with disease severity. Hepatic HMGCS2 expression paralleled circulating ketone body concentrations, indicating that HMGCS2-mediated ketogenic dysregulation contributed to NAFLD pathogenesis in T2DM contexts. HMGCS2 overexpression in NASH-T2DM models significantly attenuated steatohepatitis progression through the enhancement of ketogenesis. Cynaroside administration ameliorated hepatic pathology in NASH-T2DM mice by (1) reducing hepatocellular injury and lobular inflammation; (2) decreasing intrahepatic lipid accumulation; and (3) suppressing hepatocyte senescence and the secretion of SASP factors. Mechanistically, cynaroside exerted therapeutic effects via HMGCS2-mediated ketogenesis. Our data demonstrated that ketogenic modulation is a viable therapeutic strategy to delay T2DM-NAFLD progression."

The aim of the study is a) to investigate the possible discriminative value of adropin for newly onset AF in patients with HFpEF without a previous history of AF and who are being treated in accordance with conventional guideline and b) to compare it with predictive potencies of conventionally used predictors. A total of 953 patients with HFpEF who had sinus rhythm on ECG were enrolled in the study. The course of the observation was 3 years. Echocardiography and assessment of conventional hematological, biochemical parameters and biomarker assay including N-terminal brain natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), galectin-3, interleukin-6, soluble suppressor tumorigenisity-2 (sST2) and adropin, were performed at baseline. Incident atrial fibrillation was found in 172 patients with HFpEF, whereas 781 had sinus rhythm.

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health challenge marked by chronic hyperglycemia, which can result in complications such as diabetic cardiomyopathy. Sitagliptin, an oral anti-hyperglycemic drug, has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating cardiovascular complications associated with DM. This study explored the impact of Sitagliptin's potential as a therapeutic agent, functioning not only to control blood sugar levels but also to enhance vascular health and strengthen cardiac resilience in diabetes. The investigation focused on alterations in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor-1 (FLT-1) signaling pathways, as well as its potential to suppress inflammation and oxidative stress. A number of rats received a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) 55 mg\/kg (i.p.) to induce DM. Sitagliptin was administered orally (100 mg\/kg\/90 days) to normal and diabetic rats, after which samples were collected for investigation. Sitagliptin significantly mitigated weight loss in diabetic rats. Its administration significantly reduced blood glucose levels and improved serum troponin I and CK-MB levels. Heart sections from diabetic rats showed a marked increase in mTOR, VEGF, and FLT-1 immune reaction, while sitagliptin-treated diabetic rats' heart sections showed moderate immune reactions. Sitagliptin's protective effect was also associated with reduced inflammation, and apoptotic markers. In conclusion, Sitagliptin is suggested to offer beneficial effects on the vascular health of cardiac blood vessels, thereby potentially reducing myocardial stress in diabetic patients."

Additionally, the study sought to estimate the prevalence of DEBs and analyze its associations with glycemic control and diabetes-related complications. A cross-cultural validation study was conducted following the COSMIN guidelines. The DEPS-R questionnaire was translated into Arabic through forward and backward translation involving expert panels, including psychiatrists, diabetologists, and linguists. A sample of 409 people with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D) (58.4% females) aged 12-20 years was recruited from outpatient diabetes clinics in the five main regions of Saudi Arabia. Participants completed the Arabic DEPS-R and the validated Arabic version of the SCOFF questionnaire. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data were collected, and statistical analyses, including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and internal consistency tests, were conducted. The Arabic DEPS-R exhibits strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.829) and high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.861), with a CFA supporting a three-factor structure, namely body weight perception, disordered eating behaviors (DEBs), and bulimic tendencies. Notably, higher DEPS-R scores are significantly linked to elevated HbA1c levels, increased BMI, and more frequent insulin use. Alarmingly, 52.8% of participants show high-risk DEB, which is directly associated with poor glycemic control (HbA1c \u2265 8.1%) and a heightened risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The Arabic DEPS-R is a valid and reliable tool for screening DEBs among Saudi adolescents with T1D. Findings underscore the necessity for early identification and intervention to mitigate the impact of EDs on diabetes management and overall health outcomes."

        "Abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm in estimating the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Medical records of 532 T2D patients from the Diabetology Unit in Padova, Italy, were analyzed using the Metaclinic AI Prediction Module, which estimates the probability of heart and cerebrovascular organ damage. For patients identified as \"Very high\" (n\u2009=\u200963) or \"Low\" (n\u2009=\u2009122) risk for heart disease, additional clinical and instrumental data on their cardiac history were collected. The level of agreement between AI predictions and traditional clinical-instrumental diagnostics was assessed using Cohen's \u03ba coefficient. In the \"Very high\" risk group, the agreement between AI predictions and clinical diagnostics for heart disease was poor (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.00), while prediction for cerebrovascular disease showed excellent agreement (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.89). Similarly, in the \"Low\" risk group, agreement for heart disease remained poor (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.00), but agreement for cerebrovascular disease was again high (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.83). A marked difference was observed in the algorithm's performance. While the AI showed strong predictive ability for cerebrovascular complications, it failed to reliably predict heart disease risk. These results suggest that the algorithm may be clinically valuable for cerebrovascular risk assessment but needs refinement for cardiac prediction."

This study introduces an advanced AI-assisted recognition system designed to enhance the detection of DR lesions through innovative automatic learning methods. Central to our approach are agnostic text instruction templates, which facilitate zero-shot DR detection by integrating text embeddings with visual information. Our system performs comprehensive lesion detection by leveraging similarity mapping at both the image and patch levels, enabling it to identify a wide range of diabetic retinopathy (DR) lesions without the need for extensive annotated data. This AI-assisted system distinguishes itself from traditional fully supervised models and few-shot learning approaches by addressing the complexities of DR image annotation and safeguarding patient privacy. To validate the system's effectiveness, we conducted extensive experiments across five internal and publicly available test sets, as well as an external test set captured using smartphone devices. Our evaluation involved performance analysis of various pre-training methods, including detailed patch-level visualizations and t-SNE clustering techniques to assess the quality of feature embeddings. The results of our zero-shot experiments reveal that our system outperforms conventional transfer learning-based DR detection methods. This superiority is evident in both the pre-training and testing phases, showcasing the system's ability to deliver accurate and reliable DR lesion detection while circumventing the limitations of traditional approaches."

This study explored markers of glycaemic control, systemic inflammation, and lipid-related atherogenicity, and their relationship with CVD risk among a population of Nigerian patients with T2DM and co-morbid hypertension. This hospital-based cross-sectional analytical study was conducted over a period of 13 months among patients with T2DM, including those with co-morbid hypertension. The 10-year estimated CVD risk was determined using the WHO CVD risk assessment chart validated for Western sub-Saharan Africa, while glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were assessed as markers of glycaemic control, atherogenicity, and inflammation, respectively. Statistical analyses, including binary logistic regression, were conducted using SPSS version 25, with significance set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. Hypertensive patients with T2DM had significantly higher hsCRP (2.57\u00a0mg\/L, IQR: 2.63 vs. 0.86\u00a0mg\/L, IQR: 1.72; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and AIP (0.071, IQR: 0.39 vs. 0.002, IQR: 0.34; p\u2009=\u20090.015). They also had significantly higher mean WHO CVD risk scores (11.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7 vs. 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1; p\u2009<\u20090.001), with 60.0% (n\u2009=\u200975) classified as moderate-to-high risk. However, after adjusting for potential confounders in the multivariable analysis, HbA1c (OR\u2009=\u20090.82, p\u2009=\u20090.062), hsCRP (OR\u2009=\u20091.01, p\u2009=\u20090.905), and AIP (OR\u2009=\u20092.22, p\u2009=\u20090.293) did not emerge as significant predictors. Although hsCRP and AIP levels were elevated in higher CVD risk categories, they did not independently predict risk among patients with T2DM and hypertension. This highlights the limited utility of traditional biochemical markers in this group and the need for early risk assessment and aggressive blood pressure control. Further multicentre studies are needed to validate these results and inform targeted interventions in resource-limited settings."

        "Abstract":"Obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and steatohepatitis associated with metabolic dysfunction (MASLD) are on the rise and pose serious health challenges worldwide. In recent years, researchers have gained a better understanding of the important role of the gut microbiota in the development and progression of these diseases. Intestinal dysbiosis can contribute to the occurrence of increased intestinal permeability, inflammation and reduced numbers of commensal bacteria. In obesity, these changes contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation and deregulated metabolism. In MASLD, gut microbiota dysbiosis can promote liver fibrosis and impair bile acid metabolism, while in T2DM, they are associated with impaired glycemic control and insulin resistance. Regular physical activity has a positive effect on the composition of the gut microbiota, increasing its diversity, modulating its metabolic functions, strengthening the intestinal barrier and reducing inflammation. These findings suggest that exercise and microbiota-targeted interventions may play an important role in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases."

Fyn plays a role in increasing fat accumulation and promoting insulin resistance, and it also contributes to the development of diabetic complications such as diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy. The primary mechanism by which Fyn modulates lipid metabolism is that it inhibits AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Additionally, it affects energy homeostasis through regulating specific signal pathways affecting lipid metabolism including pathways related to CD36, through enhancement of adipocyte differentiation, and through modulating insulin signal transduction. Inflammatory stress is one of the fundamental mechanisms in diabetes mellitus and its complications. Fyn also plays a role in inflammatory stress-related signaling cascades such as the Akt\/GSK-3\u03b2\/Fyn\/Nrf2 pathway, exacerbating inflammation in diabetes mellitus. Therefore, Fyn emerges as a promising therapeutic target for regulating glucolipid metabolism and alleviating type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review synthesizes research on the role of Fyn in the regulation of energy metabolism and the development of diabetes mellitus, while exploring its specific regulatory mechanisms."

Chronic hyperglycemia exposes patients to severe complications. Among these, diabetic vascular lesions are the most destructive. Their primary driver is the synergistic interaction between hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. This review systematically elucidates how multiple pathological pathways-namely, metabolic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and epigenetic reprogramming-cooperate to drive oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades. Confronting this complex pathological network, natural products, unlike conventional single-target synthetic drugs, exert multi-target synergistic effects, simultaneously modulating several key pathogenic networks. This enables the restoration of redox homeostasis and the suppression of inflammatory responses, thereby improving vascular function and delaying both microvascular and macrovascular disease progression. However, the clinical translation of natural products still faces multiple challenges and requires comprehensive mechanistic studies and rigorous validation to fully realize their therapeutic potential."

        "Title":"Combined Bioinformatic and Experimental Approaches to Analyze miR-182-3p and miR-24-3p Expression and Their Target Genes in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Iron Deficiency Anemia During Pregnancy.",
        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are the most common pregnancy-related conditions resulting in adverse maternal and fetal complications. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), particularly miR-182-3p and miR-24-3p, are promising biomarkers as they act as regulatory elements in various diseases; however, their roles in GDM and IDA are unclear. The present study aimed to analyze the expression and functional relevance of miR-182-3p and miR-24-3p in GDM and IDA. Experimental validation via RT-PCR revealed significant upregulation of both miRNAs in GDM and IDA samples. We identified common target genes and signaling pathways associated with these miRNAs, using a combination of data mining, bioinformatic tools (miRDB, TargetScan, miRTarBase, and miRWalk), and differentially expressed gene (DEGs) analysis using the GEO, OMIM, MalaCards, and GeneCards datasets. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the shared miRNA-mRNA in target genes were enriched in insulin signaling, apoptosis, and inflammatory pathways-key mechanisms implicated in GDM and IDA. Furthermore, hub genes such as IRS1, PIK3CA, CASP3, MAPK7, and PDGFRB were identified, supporting their central role in metabolic dysregulation during pregnancy. These findings demonstrate the potential of miR-182-3p and miR-24-3p as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in managing GDM and IDA, offering new insights into the molecular interplay underlying pregnancy complications."

        "Abstract":"Neonatal sepsis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns worldwide. Although the implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has led to changes in the microbiological landscape of early-onset sepsis (EOS), the incidence among full-term neonates has not declined as expected. This underscores the ongoing need to identify and understand maternal and neonatal risk factors to inform more effective prevention strategies. We conducted a nationwide, population-based matched case-control study using data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, encompassing all pregnant individuals and their term infants in Taiwan. The primary objective was to identify clinical risk factors associated with EOS by comparing neonates diagnosed with EOS to matched controls without EOS. Conditional logistic regression was used for statistical analysis, adjusting for relevant maternal and neonatal covariates. A total of 1,694,043 mother-term infant pairs were included in the analysis, representing one of the largest national cohorts to date. Despite the implementation of a universal antenatal screening program and IAP in 2012, the incidence of clinical EOS did not decline over the study period and showed a slight increase around 2018. Adjusted analyses identified several significant risk factors for EOS, including chorioamnionitis (OR 8.99; 95% CI, 3.07-26.33), maternal pneumonia (OR 17.35; 95% CI, 6.85-43.90), Cesarean section (OR 1.45; 95% CI, 1.28-1.64), maternal diabetes mellitus (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.52-2.51), maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy (OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.17-1.52), premature rupture of membranes (PROM) (OR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.32-2.15), birth weight (OR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-0.99) (all p\u2009<\u20090.001), and maternal genitourinary tract infections (OR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.22-2.80; p\u2009=\u20090.004). Mortality was notably higher among neonates with EOS (0.667%) compared to those without EOS (0.0926%) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This study provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of EOS risk in term neonates using a nationwide dataset. Our findings indicate that cesarean delivery, maternal antibiotic use, specific maternal infections, maternal diabetes mellitus, premature rupture of membranes, and lower birth weight are associated with an increased risk of EOS. Further research is warranted to explore the potential causal relationships underlying these associations."

        "Abstract":"Vitamin deficiency could increase the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Thus, this study aimed to determine the association between dietary vitamin intake and the prevalence of T2DM among the Malaysian adult population. This cross-sectional study involved 9,314 participants from Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology Study (PURE) conducted in Malaysia. The participants comprised of 43% (4003) males and 57% (5311) females with mean age of 51.2\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4 years old. Participants were classified into the T2DM group if they reported having been diagnosed with T2DM or had a glucose level of \u2265\u20097 mmol\/L (fasting blood glucose) or \u2265\u200911.1 mmol\/L (non-fasting blood glucose). A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to measure the participants' usual dietary intake. The intake of dietary vitamins A, B6, B9, B12, C, E, and K was calculated based on nutrient databases. The T2DM prevalence was 16.9% among Malaysian adult population. The prevalences of inadequate dietary vitamin intake were elevated for vitamins A (22.8%) and C (28.8%), and notably high for vitamins B6 (98.3%), B9 (100.0%), B12 (80.5%), E (91.3%), and K (82.2%). The intake of dietary vitamins B6, B9, B12, C, E, and K was significantly lower among T2DM patients compared to those without T2DM (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) when adjusted for covariates. Additionally, higher intake of dietary vitamins A, B6, B9, B12, C, E, and K was significantly associated with a reduced prevalence of T2DM (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) when adjusted for covariates. This study found an alarming deficiency of vitamins A, B6, B9, B12, C, E, and K in the dietary intake among the Malaysian adult population regardless of T2DM status. The dietary vitamin deficiency (vitamins B6, B9, B12, E, and K) was more susceptible among those with T2DM compared to non-T2DM. This study indicated that higher dietary vitamin intake (vitamins A, B6, B9, B12, C, E, and K) could benefit by reducing the prevalence of T2DM. Therefore, an adequate intake of dietary vitamins is crucial for this study population to reduce the prevalence of T2DM."

        "Abstract":"Tissue glycation, assessed through skin autofluorescence (SAF) using an AGE reader, is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as mortality from both CVD and cancer. It was also suggested that higher SAF be linked to a greater incidence of cancer. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between SAF and the time to a new cancer diagnosis in the Lifelines Cohort Study, a population-based study in the Northern Netherlands, in participants with and without T2D. Initial participants' screening was performed between 2006 and 2013. Detailed pathology diagnoses were obtained from the Dutch Nationwide Pathology Databank (Palga) and linked to Lifelines data up to March 2023. We performed Cox proportional hazards analyses adjusted for confounders to investigate the relationship between SAF and cancer incidence. A total of 77,961 participants (75,678 without T2D; 42% males; mean age 43\u2009\u00b1\u200912 years and 2,283 with T2D; 53% males; mean age 56\u2009\u00b1\u200912 years), who were free of cancer, were followed for a median of 11.5 years. Cumulative cancer incidence was 10.7% in males and 12.5% in females without diabetes, and 23.6% and 20.2% in males and females with T2D, respectively. SAF was significantly linked to an increased cancer incidence (HR 2.36, 95% CI 2.26-2.45, p\u2009<\u20090.001) in the entire cohort. This relationship was significantly stronger in males than in females (HR 3.13, 95% CI 2.95-3.33, p\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. 1.96, 95% CI 1.86-2.07, p\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjusting for age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, pack-years of smoking and presence of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, the association between SAF and cancer remained significant (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Sensitivity analyses for incident cancers diagnosed more than 2 years after baseline Lifelines screening and incident cancer after skin cancer exclusion yielded similar results. Especially lung, oesophageal and urinary tract cancer (all p\u2009<\u20090.001) and ovarian, female genital and liver cancer (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were associated with increased SAF. Similarly, higher SAF was linked to increased cancer incidence in people with T2D (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.50-2.06, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This relationship was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age and sex (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.89-1.29) or for all confounders (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86-1.32). We conclude that, alongside its previously established application in evaluating the risk of future diabetes, CVD, as well as cause-specific mortality in people without diabetes, higher SAF measurements are linked to a slightly higher incidence of cancer."

        "Abstract":"Reactive hypoglycaemia is a condition where blood glucose drops after a glucose load, and may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to determine the association between gestational reactive hypoglycaemia (GRH) and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including those related to diabetes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching 4 databases: Medline, Embase, Web of science, and Maternity & infant care database, from inception to 1 December 2023. The outcomes of interest were any reported adverse pregnancy outcomes including large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia, small for gestational age (SGA), fetal growth restriction (FGR), low birth weight (LBW), caesarean delivery, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, neonatal hypoglycaemia, polyhydramnios, 5-min APGAR score\u2009<\u20097 and preterm delivery. Risk of bias assessment was performed with Newcastle Ottawa scale. Subgroup analysis was also performed. From 14,746 records, 42 studies were selected for full-text assessment. Thirty studies reporting on 114,148 participants, including 18,878 women with GRH, fulfilled eligibility criteria. Pregnancies with observed GRH had higher risk of SGA (RR\u2009=\u20091.49, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.33, 1.68), LBW (RR\u2009=\u20091.35, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.13, 1.60), FGR (RR\u2009=\u20091.21, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.05, 1.41), and NICU admission (RR\u2009=\u20091.23, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.02, 1.49) compared to the euglycaemic group. At subgroup analyses, GRH diagnosed at postload glucose\u2009<\u20093 mmol\/l was associated with an increased risk of NICU admission (RR\u2009=\u20093.39, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.56, 7.34); and GRH limited to post glucose tolerance test (GTT) was associated with increased risk of polyhydramnios (RR\u2009=\u20091.93, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.17, 3.20) and SGA (RR\u2009=\u20091.90, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.01, 3.58). GRH is a condition not routinely diagnosed in pregnancy but associated with adverse fetal-neonatal outcomes as SGA, FGR, and NICU admission. At GTT, GRH is associated with the risk of polyhydramnios. More studies are still necessary to determine the threshold value for diagnosis of GRH and explore associations with other outcomes related to glucose dysmetabolism."

The study investigates the burden of Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes in Tamale metropolis. The target population used for the study was all outpatients from the Tamale Teaching Hospital. Secondary source of data was employed for the study. The findings reveal significant variations in hypertension prevalence across demographic categories, with the highest rates found in the 55-64 age group at 31.4% (95% CI: 26.3%-36.5%) and all age groups demonstrating statistical significance (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Findings further show the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes peaks at 28.8% in the 65-74 age group, while the 25-34 age range has the lowest rate at 1.5%. Findings from the regression analysis reveal that gender and patients' place of residence significantly influence type 2 diabetes, while age is the only variable that shows a statistically significant association with hypertension. The study concluded that Type 2 diabetes and hypertension is prevalent among older age, higher weight, male gender, self-employed, and lower education. The study recommends for implementation of targeted screening programs focusing on older adults, especially females, and those in self-employed, for Type 2 diabetes and Hypertension."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of long-term statin therapy on the risk of developing diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with NS. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2024. The association between statin use and the incidence of diabetes was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Restricted cubic splines were utilized to investigate potential nonlinear relationships between cumulative statin dose and diabetes risk. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age, sex, corticosteroid use, and other relevant clinical factors to assess possible effect modification. A total of 837 eligible NS patients were enrolled in this study, among whom 84 (10.03%) developed DM. Statin use significantly increased the risk of incident diabetes (HR 3.68, 95% CI: 1.95-6.94, p\u2009<\u20090.001), an association which remained significant after multivariable adjustment (HR 3.00, 95% CI: 1.40-6.43, p\u2009=\u20090.005). Higher risk was particularly evident among older patients (\u2265\u200955 years), those with hypertension, corticosteroid non-users, and patients with BMI\u2009\u2265\u200928. A restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a nonlinear relationship between cumulative statin dose and diabetes risk, peaking at cumulative doses of approximately 8,000-13,000\u00a0mg and declining thereafter. Statin therapy independently predicts an elevated risk of diabetes among patients with nephrotic syndrome. This relationship exhibits dose-dependent nonlinear characteristics, suggesting careful consideration of cumulative statin dose is warranted when managing lipid disorders in this patient population."

        "Abstract":"This study investigates the role and primary mechanisms of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in regulating corneal epithelial injury repair and nerve regeneration under diabetic conditions. Type 1 diabetes was induced in C57BL\/6 mice via streptozotocin injection. Platelet depletion was achieved using an anti-mouse GPIb\u03b1 antibody. Platelet levels were quantified in intra- and extravascular compartments of the corneal limbus. Concentrations of growth factors released by activated platelets were measured in human and murine diabetic and nondiabetic samples. Diabetic mice with corneal epithelial wounds received PDGF-BB eye drops alone or combined with ERK1\/2 or AKT inhibitors. Platelet-depleted mice were treated with PDGF-BB eye drops, while wild-type C57BL\/6 mice received subconjunctival anti-PDGF-BB antibody injections. Human primary corneal limbal epithelial stem cells (HLECs) from diabetic and nondiabetic donors were treated with anti-PDGF-BB antibodies or PDGF-BB small interfering RNA. Diabetic individuals exhibited reduced peripheral blood platelet counts and diminished PDGF-BB expression following platelet activation. Both platelet depletion and hyperglycemia impaired corneal epithelial repair and nerve regeneration, correlating with reduced PDGF-BB levels. Inhibiting PDGF-BB signaling significantly delayed corneal epithelial healing and nerve regeneration in wild-type mice. In vitro, PDGF-BB enhanced HLEC migration and proliferation. PDGF-BB promoted corneal epithelial repair and nerve regeneration in diabetic mice via ERK1\/2 and AKT pathway activation. Hyperglycemia suppresses PDGF-BB expression, impairing corneal epithelial wound healing and nerve regeneration by inhibiting ERK1\/2 and AKT signaling. PDGF-BB may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for diabetic keratopathy."

Consequently, Semaglutide prescription rates have increased for both its indicated and off-label uses. A possible link between GLP-1 RAs and suicidal behavior has been proposed. CASE REPORT We describe a rare case of suicide-related behavior, adverse outcomes, and a self-injected Semaglutide overdose in a 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and overweight. The patient had been on a weekly 1-mg Semaglutide regimen for 1 year prior to hospitalization. He presented with multiorgan failure, hypoglycemia, cholestatic liver dysfunction, and 2 duodenal ulcers, and reported weakness, appetite loss, epigastric pain, severe diarrhea, and melena over 2 weeks, and syncope the day before admission. His clinical status improved gradually, including duodenal ulcers upon discharge. In further questioning, the patient recalled feeling moody and injecting his monthly Semaglutide prescription all at 1 time, 14 days before admission. The self-injection of an overdose 4 times greater than permitted may be considered suicidal behavior for 6 reasons: (1) Semaglutide treatment began more than 1 year before the event; (2) The patient was experienced in self-injecting; (3) A single injection is limited to the weekly recommended dose; (4) If multiple injections exceed the pre-filled monthly amount, an overdose might occur; (5) Semaglutide application by pen is very safe; and (6) He reported being dysphoric prior to the event. CONCLUSIONS Patients receiving GLP-1 Ras, such as Semaglutide, should be screened for common mental disorders in clinical practice. Also, we suggest multiorgan failure should be excluded in Semaglutide-treated patients with acute illness onset."

This study assessed the prevalence and trends of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in the Polish population over time. Data from 705,399 individuals aged 35-55 years enrolled in a CVD prevention program (2012-2021) were analyzed. Risk factors included smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, low physical activity, overweight, obesity, and elevated glucose. Sex-specific differences and time trends were evaluated. Smoking prevalence decreased significantly in men (36-27.29%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and women (24-17.98%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Hypertension was more prevalent in men (17.45-19.62%) than women (6.84-8.58%), with significant curvilinear change over time (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Elevated total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) declined significantly (-3.29, p\u2009<\u20090.001; -3.11 [mg\/dL], p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Low physical activity remained prevalent (>\u200975%), while overweight and obesity affected more men (49.45% and 24.69%) than women (31.67% and 17.12%). Mean glucose levels rose slightly (p\u2009=\u20090.045). Mean SCORE values decreased significantly over time (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Improvements in smoking prevalence, TC, LDL-C, and SCORE values reflect progress in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. However, persistent physical inactivity, overweight, and rising glucose levels highlight the need for intensified preventive efforts targeting metabolic and lifestyle risk factors."

        "Abstract":"Inflammation plays a crucial role in promoting coronary artery disease (CAD). The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is a novel comprehensive indicator reflecting systemic inflammation, with previous studies indicating its association with cardiovascular events and mortality. However, the correlation between NLR and the severity of new-onset CAD at different glucose metabolism has not been explored. This study aims to determine the relationship between NLR and the new-onset of CAD and severity of coronary artery lesions in patients with varying levels of glucose metabolism. In this retrospective study, 1689 patients with acute coronary syndromes who underwent coronary angiography were included. Based on patients\u2019 medical history and fasting blood glucose levels, subjects\u2019 glucose metabolism status was categorized as normal glucose regulation (NGR), pre-diabetes mellitus (Pre-DM), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The severity of CAD was assessed using the Gensini score (GS), and subjects were divided into three groups based on GS tertiles. The relationship between NLR and CAD was validated through logistic regression analysis. The Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) was employed to determine the quantitative relationship between NLR and GS in different populations. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between elevated NLR levels and increased odds ratio (OR) of CAD in the fully adjusted model, regardless of the glucose metabolic state. Specifically, in individuals with NGR, the OR was 1.13[95%CI: (1.07, 1.20), <i>P<\/i><0.001]; in Pre-DM, the OR was 1.11[95%CI: (1.01, 1.21), <i>P<\/i><0.001] and in DM, the OR was 1.08[95%CI: (1.02, 1.15), <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.009]. It is noteworthy that there was no statistical correlation between NLR and the severity of CAD in the DM population, while an association was observed in non-diabetic patients. The RCS analysis confirmed a nonlinear relationship between NLR and the GS in total population and NGR group (P for nonlinear\u2009<\u20090.05), with distinct inflection points, which was not observed in the Pre-DM and DM groups. There is a correlation between NLR and the occurrence of new-onset CAD, and more importantly, NLR reflects the severity of CAD to some extent, and this correlation is more common in patients with NGR and Pre-DM; however, in patients with DM, NLR does not accurately reflect the extent of coronary artery disease.

        "Abstract":"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), a serious complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), is characterized by delayed wound healing and is a major cause of nontraumatic amputation. This study investigated cinnamaldehyde's regulatory effect on DFU and its underlying mechanisms. A DFU model was established in BALB\/c mice using streptozotocin (STZ); mice received cinnamaldehyde (100\u00a0mg\/kg, intraperitoneally). In vitro, cells were treated with 10\u00a0\u03bcM cinnamaldehyde. Histology, ELISA, immunofluorescence, western blotting, tube formation, and transwell assays were employed. Results showed cinnamaldehyde effectively improved DFU healing, evidenced by accelerated wound closure, reduced inflammatory infiltration, increased CD31 expression, and lower oxidative stress. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde suppressed Advanced Glycation End products (AGE)\/Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) signaling and its downstream proteins p-IKB\u03b1 and p-NF-\u03baB p65 (supported by GSE134431 dataset analysis). Cinnamaldehyde reversed STZ-induced shifts in macrophage populations, decreasing M1-like (CD86<sup>+<\/sup>) and increasing M2-like (CD206+) macrophages. This M2 polarization was RAGE-dependent, as RAGE overexpression (OE-RAGE) counteracted cinnamaldehyde's effects on iNOS and Arg-1 levels in macrophages. These findings indicate cinnamaldehyde facilitated M2 macrophage polarization in DFU wounds via AGE\/RAGE signaling. Furthermore, cinnamaldehyde-induced, AGE\/RAGE-mediated macrophage polarization subsequently promoted human dermal fibroblast (HDF) proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Importantly, cinnamaldehyde also modulated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway under high glucose conditions, contributing to increased antioxidant signaling activity. Our work reveals cinnamaldehyde promotes diabetic wound healing through synergistic effects involving AGE\/RAGE-mediated macrophage polarization (affecting fibroblast activation and angiogenesis) and Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses."

This research was done to assess the adherence to medication and factors associated with it among patients with diabetes and hypertension in rural Tamil Nadu. Materials and methods A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted over three months (April-June 2025) among diabetic and hypertensive patients attending the outpatient department of a Rural Health Centre in Tiruvallur, Tamil Nadu. Adults diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and\/or hypertension for at least one year and who consented to the study were included. The required sample size was 174, based on a prevalence of 67.1% medication adherence, and 195 participants were ultimately enrolled. Data were collected using a pretested questionnaire covering sociodemographic details, disease status, and the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (approval number: CSP-MED\/25\/FEB\/113\/30). Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Results The age of study participants ranged from 35 to 85 years, and the average age was 57.05 years. Most of the participants were females (53.3%, n=104); 36.9% (n=72) of the participants had only diabetes, 24.6% (n=48) had only hypertension, and 38.5% (n=75) had both conditions. The prevalence of medication adherence was 58.5% (n=114, 95% CI: 51.4-65.2). Patients aged \u226450 years (OR: 2.19, p=0.020) and those on monotherapy (OR: 2.03, p=0.033) were significantly more adherent. Other variables such as sex, marital status, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities were not significantly associated with adherence. Conclusions Nearly half the patients were non-adherent, posing a public health concern. Age and complexity of drug regimen were significant predictors of adherence. Interventions such as patient education, fixed-dose combinations, and digital reminders should be prioritized to improve adherence and reduce complications."

        "Abstract":"Pulmonary aspergilloma is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening condition that predominantly affects individuals with pre-existing structural lung disease and immunosuppression. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially with long-term immunosuppressive therapy, significantly increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections, including fungal pathogens such as <i>Aspergillus<\/i> species. These patients are also at heightened risk for a broad range of opportunistic infections,\u00a0such as <i>Candida<\/i> species, viral infections\u00a0such as herpes zoster and cytomegalovirus (CMV),\u00a0<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i>, and <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii<\/i> pneumonia (PJP). We report a case of a 50-year-old woman with long-standing SLE and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus who developed multilobar pulmonary aspergilloma while on chronic glucocorticoids and azathioprine. Despite initial improvement, she developed hemoptysis, necessitating bronchial artery embolization consideration. Due to extensive bilateral disease, surgical intervention was deferred, and she was successfully managed with prolonged voriconazole therapy. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of aspergilloma in immunocompromised hosts and highlights the importance of vigilant monitoring and tailored antifungal strategies."

        "Abstract":"Acquired reactive perforating collagenosis (ARPC) is a rare dermatosis associated with diabetes mellitus, characterized by transepidermal elimination of collagen and intense pruritus. We report the case of a 77-year-old Japanese woman with poorly controlled diabetes who developed multiple pruritic, keratotic nodules on her chest, back, and limbs. Histopathological examination revealed full-thickness epidermal defects with prominent transepidermal elimination of thickened collagen fibers, along with dense lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates in the dermis, findings consistent with ARPC. Despite improved glycemic control, her skin lesions and pruritus persisted. Treatment with subcutaneous nemolizumab (60 mg every four weeks), an anti-IL-31 receptor A monoclonal antibody, resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and marked flattening of the skin lesions within two months. This case highlights the potential role of IL-31-targeted therapy in managing refractory ARPC. The clinical improvement observed with nemolizumab suggests it may be a promising therapeutic option in selected cases; however, further studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy."

        "Abstract":"Purpose To evaluate the impact of incretin-based pharmacotherapy on clinical outcomes in normal to underweight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a real-world setting. Methods Patients with a body mass index less than 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> prescribed a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist\/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes mellitus within a single health system were included in this analysis. The primary objective is a change in hemoglobin A1c from baseline to at least three months after an optimally tolerated incretin-based pharmacotherapeutic agent dose. Key secondary objectives include the absolute change in weight, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and systolic blood pressure from baseline to optimization, as well as the absolute change in the number of diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol medications. Additionally, the number of patients who meet the categorization as underweight from baseline to optimization will be assessed. Results Within the health system described, 100 patients out of the 7942 prescribed an incretin-based pharmacotherapeutic agent within the two-year timeframe met inclusion criteria. Of these, 45 were on the medication for at least six months and had complete post-optimization records and so were included in the analysis. Within this population, the average baseline hemoglobin A1c was 8.83%, and after dose optimization, it was 7.98%. The average hemoglobin A1c change was -0.84% (P = 0.008) from baseline to optimization. The average baseline weight in the population analyzed was 64.3 kg, and after dose optimization, it was 62.7 kg. The average change in weight after optimization was -1.61 kg (P = 0.01), and the average change in body mass index after optimization was -0.45 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (P = 0.38). The average changes in LDL and systolic blood pressure after optimization were -10 mg\/dL (P = 0.02) and -4 mmHg (P = 0.28), respectively. Conclusion An observation of significantly improved hemoglobin A1c was seen in this real-world analysis of normal-weight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus prescribed incretin-based pharmacotherapy. Weight loss was modest, and the change in body mass index was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that incretin-based pharmacotherapy is effective in improving glycemic control in this population with modest weight reduction. Further studies are needed to explore the long-term efficacy and safety of incretin-based pharmacotherapy in normal and underweight individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

A systemic review of the documents related to DADE had been performed based on the Web of Science database prior to achieving the plain text files of authors, titles, journals, and abstracts which afterwards had been imported into Citespace and VOSviewer software for data cleansing. The visual analysis was implemented from the following aspects: journals' publications, author and national cooperation, keyword co-occurrence, timeline analysis, and burst detection. The 318 documents in 167 journals had been incorporated with the overall annual citations and annual publications respectively growing significantly since 2014 and 2016. The keyword co-occurrence networks formed 4 clusters, with the representative keywords being dry eye, diabetes mellitus, prevalence, and diabetic retinopathy. Both the timeline map and the burst detection demonstrated that in the exploration of the pathogenesis of DADE, initial research was dedicated to Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, followed by cross-sectional statistical analysis of the pertinent contributing factors of DADE using online databases. Precisely the oxidative stress seemed to surge into the research spotlight presently. The key pathogenic mechanisms of DADE include inflammation, oxidative stress and corneal neuropathy, contributing to the development of dry eye symptoms. Age, gender, diabetes duration, and diabetic retinopathy are strongly associated with the development of DADE, but the impact of other systemic factors require further investigation. With high prevalence of dry eye in Asia, valuable resources like the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) database offer crucial data for developing risk prediction models for DADE. Building risk prediction models using machine learning algorithms is a promising future research direction, enabling physicians to identify high-risk individuals and implement early interventions."

The results demonstrated that (1) Among 54 deceased pregnant patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), 44 patients belonged to type 1, and 3, 2, and 5 patients belonged to type 2, type 4, and type 5, respectively. In type 1, 33 cases were secondary to congenital heart disease, with ventricular septal defect being common. (2) All 54 patients were diagnosed with PAH during pregnancy or postpartum. NYHA cardiac function grade II (10 cases), \u2162 (18 cases), \u2163 (26 cases), heart disease pregnancy risk levels were all \u2163. (3) Of the 54 patients, 7 patients had no data on the time of death, and most of them (37 patients) died within 1 week postpartum. (4) These 9 patients with mild PAH death during pregnancy had lower ejection fraction, higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage, left heart failure, systemic failure, arrhythmia, gestational diabetes, and infection than those with moderate or severe PAH death during pregnancy. As a consequence, deaths in pregnancies complicated with PH were mostly caused by PAH crisis, total heart failure, multiple organ failure, Eisenmenger syndrome and maternal perinatal mortality was high. The primary causes of mortality in pregnant women with mild PH include heart failure, respiratory failure, and arrhythmia etc. Patients experiencing complications such as postpartum hemorrhage, left ventricular dysfunction, multiorgan failure, arrhythmia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and infection may have a poorer prognosis."

        "Title":"Tramadol overdose in total knee arthroplasty: A case report.",
        "Abstract":"Tramadol is a synthetic opioid analgesic commonly employed in postoperative pain control due to its moderate efficacy and comparatively favorable safety profile. Nonetheless, overdose can result in significant adverse effects, notably central nervous system depression. This risk is amplified in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where reduced renal clearance may potentiate drug accumulation and toxicity. Elderly patients are particularly at risk owing to age-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We describe a case of tramadol overdose in a 77-year-old male with stage 3 CKD following total knee arthroplasty. A 77-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and CKD stage 3 underwent elective right total knee arthroplasty for grade 4 osteoarthritis under spinal anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation revealed deranged renal function tests but no other significant abnormalities. Postoperative pain was managed with multimodal analgesics, including intravenous tramadol and a buprenorphine skin patch. On postoperative third day, the patient was found unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale 8\/15) with mild respiratory depression. Investigations ruled out stroke, pulmonary embolism, or other cardiopulmonary events. Elevated serum tramadol levels suggested opioid toxicity exacerbated by impaired renal clearance. The buprenorphine patch was removed, and diuresis was initiated. Supportive management, including prophylactic intubation, led to recovery of consciousness within 48 hours, and the patient was extubated and mobilized by postoperative sixth day. Pain control was maintained with oral paracetamol and pregabalin. The patient was discharged on postoperative tenth day in stable condition with improved pain scores and mobility. This case underscores the need for cautious use of tramadol in elderly patients with CKD due to impaired drug clearance and the potential for toxicity. It highlights the importance of close monitoring, judicious analgesic use, and prompt management of complications to ensure favorable postoperative outcomes in high-risk populations. This case underscores the necessity for judicious tramadol administration in elderly patients with CKD, as diminished renal function markedly impairs drug clearance, predisposing to toxicity. Vigilant assessment of renal function and individualized dose adjustments are essential to mitigate the risk of adverse events in this demographic. Clinicians should maintain a heightened awareness of potential opioid toxicity in postoperative patients presenting with unexplained neurological manifestations. Timely identification and initiation of appropriate supportive measures are pivotal in achieving favorable clinical outcomes."

This study explores clinical and molecular links between DM and HNSCC through integrative analyses of patient data and bioinformatics. A retrospective cohort of 728 HNSCC patients was analyzed to assess sex-specific co-occurrence with DM. A simulation-based epidemiological model quantified associations based on observed clinical data and population incidence rates. Literature-based data mining was used to extract gene-disease associations for DM and HNSCC, followed by functional enrichment, pathway and network analyses of overlapping genes. The simulation revealed a significant association between DM and HNSCC, stronger in males (Odds Ratio [OR] = 3.03, p = 6.28 \u00d7 10<sup>-50<\/sup>) than in females (OR = 2.18, p = 8.7 \u00d7 10<sup>-12<\/sup>).

Among them, microwave coagulation is a promising endobronchial therapy for a wide range of neoplasms due to its high efficacy and safety. Meanwhile, endobronchial lipoma is a benign tumour that is rarely observed in the lungs. To our knowledge, the efficacy of microwave coagulation has not been reported in the treatment of endobronchial lipoma. Here, we report the effectiveness of endoscopic microwave coagulation therapy in safely resolving atelectasis and cough caused by endobronchial lipoma. Surgical resection was deemed to be unsuitable in this case due to the likelihood of extensive surgery such as right lower lobectomy being required, and comorbidities including poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. There was an elevated risk of perioperative complications. This report presents a new, effective, and minimally invasive treatment option for endobronchial lipoma in endoscopic microwave coagulation to relieve atelectasis."

        "Abstract":"Hyperglycemia in Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) induces excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through various pathways, leading to oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which collectively contribute to kidney damage. Currently, the treatment of DKD remains a significant challenge. Magnesium, an essential mineral, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for DKD due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Magnesium has been shown to alleviate renal fibrosis, maintain tubular integrity and function, improve endothelial cell function, and regulate renal hemodynamics. As a cofactor of antioxidant enzymes, Magnesium directly scavenges ROS and enhances the expression of antioxidant proteins. This review explores the relationship between Magnesium and DKD, examining how Magnesium mitigates oxidative stress through the PI3K\/AKT\/FoxO3a pathway, inhibits ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells via the AMPK\/FoxO3a\/Nrf2 pathway, and reduces autophagy and apoptosis, thereby delaying DKD progression. The review further discusses how Magnesium regulates the pivotal FoxO3a protein, a transcription factor with antioxidant properties, leading to the prevention of DKD, and proposes Magnesium supplementation as a potential clinical strategy for alleviating DKD, offering a new therapeutic approach for its treatment."

The majority of insulin resistance is closely associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, resulting in impaired insulin signaling pathways. type 2 diabetes can be preceded by insulin resistance, and therefore, it is crucial to stop the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) holds a bright future in the therapeutic study of insulin resistance; it is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and immune homeostasis while ameliorating the impaired insulin signaling pathway, improving the state of insulin resistance through multiple aspects. In this review, we describe the physiological properties and signaling pathways of FGF21 and elaborate on the mechanism of action of FGF21 in improving insulin resistance.

        "Abstract":"The gut microbiome has been linked to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), identifying it as a promising therapeutic target. Nutritional interventions, which are an effective way to modulate the gut microbiome, thus show potential to be applied as complementary therapies for T1D. One particular dietary intervention, prolonged therapeutic fasting, has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of several autoimmune diseases, while also modifying the gut microbiota composition of healthy populations. It is unclear, however, how the gut microbiota of patients suffering from diseases of autoimmunity will respond to fasting. In this pilot study, we investigate the effects of prolonged fasting on the gut microbiome of T1D patients: Fasting substantially changed the composition and structure of the T1D gut microbiome so that it converged with that of non-diabetic controls immediately post fasting. Moreover, a comparison with a population of patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis revealed substantial overlap in post-fasted microbiome changes and a remarkable consistency with published data of non-autoimmune populations, indicating that fasting leads to signature microbiome changes that are independent of host health status and disease type. A correlation analysis between fasting-mediated microbiota modifications and changes in clinical parameters revealed several significant associations between the <i>Oscillospiraceae<\/i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae<\/i> families and cholesterol and blood pressure changes in the T1D cohort, corroborating previous studies reporting on these associations in non-diabetic subjects. In conclusion, the observed fasting-mediated microbiome signature suggests that nutrient availability is a major disease-independent factor in shaping gut microbiome composition, likely driven by the need for metabolic diversification of microbial nutrient acquisition. The corresponding clinical associations highlight the need to investigate if these fasting-driven changes in the reported taxa are causally linked to the recorded clinical benefits of therapeutic fasting and what importance fasting as an additional therapeutic intervention might have to improve long term conditions in people with T1D."

Scientific evidence has confirmed that acemannan, the bioactive compound in aloe vera gel, exhibits significant anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that enhance tissue regeneration. This case report describes the successful application of an innovative acemannan-enriched glycolipid sphere dressing derived from aloe vera gel in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) treatment, which achieved a clinically remarkable outcome. An 80-year-old female patient with a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus experienced recurrent diabetic foot pain for 15 years. She had multiple hospitalizations due to acute infections and poorly controlled hyperglycemia. Long-term treatments included metformin and gliclazide. Upon presentation, she had a nonhealing wound on her left dorsal foot, diagnosed as a severe DFU (Texas classification: Grade II, stage D). She declined amputation and opted for conservative treatment. The medical team applied an acemannan-enriched glycolipid sphere dressing five times daily to the left calf and foot, avoiding the wound area. Frequency was reduced to three times daily after scab formation. Weight-bearing on the injured foot was avoided. Through in-person and online consultations, the team managed her lifestyle and diet, emphasizing natural foods. After 5 months, the DFU healed without significant scarring or functional loss. No recurrence was observed during the 2-year follow-up. Acemannan-enriched glycolipid sphere dressings promote DFU healing. This suggests the potential of these dressings for treating other refractory wounds."

        "Abstract":"Ocular hypertension (OHT), defined as increased intraocular pressure (IOP, > 21 mmHg) in eyes without optic disc changes or visual field changes, is a condition that puts an eye at higher risk of developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy and may be related to the translaminar pressure gradient, individual differences in IOP-related glaucoma susceptibility, effects of arterial blood pressure on the optic nerve head, and vasospastic factors. IOP remains the most common modifiable risk factor to protect eyes against the development of glaucoma. The association between OHT and diabetes mellitus (DM) is poorly understood, although ocular effects of both conditions are related to vascular compromise of retinal and optic nerve circulation. Increased IOP in diabetic patients is attributable to increased aqueous osmotic gradient and accumulation of extracellular matrix constituents in the trabecular meshwork. Autonomic dysfunction and genetic factors may also play a role. Apart from eyes without diabetic retinopathy (DR) changes, OHT can also be observed in eyes with DR, where it can develop with or without antecedent vitreoretinal intervention. For example, photocoagulation of the retina in earlier stages of proliferative DR protects against the development of OHT, whereas intraocular silicone oil injection promotes it. While IOP has been directly implicated as an independent risk factor for DR, the retinopathy in DM is also related to comorbidities, like hypertension and heart disease, that are also correlated with OHT. All these factors are discussed in a comprehensive review exploring the association of OHT and DM in detail."

        "Abstract":"Obesity is commonly associated with dysregulation of adipokines, particularly characterized by elevated leptin levels and reduced adiponectin levels. These abnormalities are closely linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. To systematically evaluate the effects of different exercise modalities-AE, RT, COM, HIIT-and their dosages on the regulation of adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) in individuals with overweight and obesity. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and January 2025. A random-effects Bayesian model was applied to perform pairwise meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, and dose-response meta-analysis to compare the effects of various exercise interventions and their respective doses. Additionally, meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore potential moderating effects of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage on the intervention outcomes. A total of 61 RCTs involving 3,069 participants were included. The network meta-analysis showed that all exercise interventions significantly increased adiponectin levels, with HIIT yielding the most pronounced effect (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.85, 95% CrI: 0.24-1.45; SUCRA\u202f=\u202f68%), followed by RT, AE, and COM. For leptin levels, COM was the most effective intervention (SMD\u202f=\u202f-0.99, 95% CrI: -1.48 to -0.51; SUCRA\u202f=\u202f84%), followed by AE and HIIT, while RT did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect. Dose-response analysis indicated an inverted U-shaped relationship between exercise and improvements in adiponectin, with the optimal effective dose around 880 MET-min\/week. In contrast, a negative linear relationship was observed between exercise and leptin, with notable improvements starting at approximately 770 MET-min\/week. The dose-response relationships varied by exercise type. Meta-regression further revealed that age and BMI were positively associated with improvements in adiponectin, while BMI and body fat percentage were positively correlated with improvements in leptin. However, age was negatively associated with changes in leptin. No significant moderating effect of sex was observed on changes in adipokine levels. This study provides moderate-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of HIIT, COM, and AE in improving adipokine profiles among individuals with overweight and obesity, although the effects differ by exercise modality. The well-defined dose-response relationships underscore the importance of individualized exercise prescriptions, with moderate to high weekly doses (approximately 800-1,300 MET-min\/week) recommended to optimize endocrine and metabolic health. Future research should further investigate inter-individual variability in response to exercise interventions and their long-term clinical benefits.

Despite several scales and scores for assessing the preoperative cardiovascular status, an individualized assessment focused on each patient is mandatory. To identify the new cardiac events that occur after non-cardiac surgery. In 100 patients hospitalized in the general surgery department with acute and chronic surgical pathologies, the perioperative cardiac events were assessed using Holter monitoring along with clinical and biochemical markers, including C reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitive troponin (hscTnI). Out of the 100 participants with a mean age of 54.5 (43-77.9) years, 54% were men. Ten patients developed paroxysmal postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF), which was related with longer surgery time 165 (150-180) vs 120 (90-150) minutes (p=0.002) and postoperative anaemia [haemoglobin (Hg) 10.4 (9.37-12.6) vs 12.1 (11-13.2) g\/dL, (p=0.041)]. Higher CRP levels were also correlated with paroxysmal AF. The AF group correlated with higher values of presurgical CRP: 81 (46.5-186.75) vs 27 (6-102.5) mg\/dL, (p=0.041). Higher postsurgical CRP values were also found in the AF group: 76 (47.75-110.75) vs 40.5 (12-82.5) mg\/dL (p=0.045). Sinus pauses were present in nine patients and there was a strong association between sinus pauses and age (p = 0.011), history of high blood pressure (HBP) (p = 0.031), intraoperative HBP (p = 0.026) and the preexisting AF (p = 0.028). Postsurgical ST changes were present in 30 patients and ST depression was correlated with age (p < 0.001), prolonged surgery time [150 (120-180) vs 120 (90-150) minutes (p < 0.001)], history of HBP [(33.3% vs 12.2%) (p=0.017)] and intraoperative maximum values of BP (p = 0.007). There is an increased risk of cardiovascular events during the postoperative period of non-cardiac surgery in patients with advanced age, pre-existing diseases (hypertension, preexisting atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus), the level of inflammation and longer intraoperative stress. Holter monitoring revealed rhythm and conduction disorders as well as ST segment changes that were associated with the inflammatory status and slightly elevated cardiac enzyme levels.

Our study aimed to investigate whether the AST\/ALT ratio is associated with GDM in a population of pregnant Korean women. The study was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. It included 623 pregnant women who were at 10-14 weeks of gestation between November 2014 and September 2016. We downloaded and analyzed the data in October 2024. A total of 575 singleton pregnant women were included after excluding missing variables. All participants were followed up until the birth of their children. AST\/ALT ratio was obtained by dividing AST by ALT. AST\/ALT ratio was used as a continuous variable, and a quartile categorical variable was used for analysis. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationship between AST\/ALT ratio and GDM. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the stability of this relationship. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve fitting was employed to investigate potential non-linear associations. Pregnant women were stratified into quartiles based on their AST\/ALT ratios, with the following cutoff values: Q1 (<1.167), Q2 (1.167-1.499), Q3 (1.5-1.818), and Q4 (>1.818). The overall mean AST\/ALT ratio across all participants was 1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0. After adjusting for confounders, the AST\/ALT ratio was negatively associated with GDM (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.2-0.99), with results confirmed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. This study demonstrated that a lower AST\/ALT ratio in early pregnancy was independently and negatively associated with the risk of GDM. The AST\/ALT ratio may serve as a potential early biomarker to identify pregnant women at higher risk of GDM, contributing to targeted preventive strategies."

        "Abstract":"To compare survival between cats diagnosed with a nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and cats diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and to determine whether clinical parameters, clinicopathologic data, and insulin type are associated with survival. Secondary objectives were to evaluate whether these parameters were associated with survival in cats undergoing a generalized hyperglycemic diabetic crisis. Retrospective evaluation of medical records of cats diagnosed with DKA and HHS between 2000 and 2020. University teaching hospital. The HHS group consisted of 29 cats (blood glucose concentration [BG] \u226531.08\u00a0mmol\/L [\u2265560\u00a0mg\/dL]; calculated serum osmolality \u2265350\u00a0mOsm\/kg; ketone negative). The DKA group consisted of 71 cats (BG \u22657.77\u00a0mmol\/L [\u2265140\u00a0mg\/dL]; pH <7.35; ketone positive). None. No clinicopathologic parameters or previous use of glargine U-100 were significantly associated with survival in the HHS group. There was no difference in survival of the HHS group versus the DKA group (65.5% vs. 68.6%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.85). In all cats, higher serum BUN (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), creatinine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0098), or BG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and lower serum sodium concentration (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) or body temperature (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0098) were associated with decreased odds of survival. Calculated total and effective osmolalities were not associated with survival in either group. Cats with HHS had a survival of 65.5% in this study. No serum biochemical parameters predicted prognosis for the HHS group, and insulin type was not found to be associated with survival. Azotemia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and hypothermia were associated with decreased survival when combining all cats. Hyperosmolality was not associated with survival; therefore, distinguishing HHS and DKA into separate syndromes may be arbitrary."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment globally. Disorganization of the retinal inner layers (DRIL), detected via optical coherence tomography, has emerged as a potential biomarker of disease severity and visual prognosis. This review explores the significance of DRIL in diabetic retinal diseases and its role in predicting visual outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, and relevant original and review articles published were included. Multiple studies have linked the extent of DRIL to both baseline visual acuity and long-term outcomes regardless of the therapeutic approach. In some cases, structural improvement in DRIL has been observed following corticosteroid treatment, suggesting potential reversibility. The presence of DRIL may aid clinicians in assessing disease severity and anticipating treatment response. With increasing interest in automated DRIL analysis using artificial intelligence tools, its role in clinical decision-making is likely to expand. Further research is needed to refine DRIL detection and explore its role in personalized patient care."

        "Abstract":"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that primarily affects the pancreas and lungs. CF dyslipidaemia is characterized by decreased circulating lipids and increased ectopic lipid deposition in liver, pancreas, and lungs. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency precedes the onset of CF related diabetes (CFRD). We hypothesized that different mechanisms contribute to CFRD development and progression, including features of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM). Thus, we compared their plasma inflammatory, metabolic\/hormonal, and lipidomic profiles, using Luminex assays and untargeted mass spectrometry analyses. Then, we compared the lipidomic profiles of lung biopsies and plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) of CFRD and patients with other lung diseases (LD). Inflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL1\u03b2) and chemokines (IL8 and MCP-1) were increased in the plasma of CFRD as compared with T1DM, whereas only cytokines increased when comparing with T2DM. Low insulin and C-peptide characterized CFRD and T1DM. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and storage lipids were reduced and free fatty acids (FA) were increased in CFRD plasma compared with T1DM and T2DM. When comparing CFRD with LD, systemic inflammation was increased to a similar extent. Increased levels of sphingolipids, glycerolipids, acylcarnitines were found in lung biopsies of CFRD as compared to LD. Increased triacylglycerols in lung biopsies positively correlated with lung inflammatory infiltrates (CD68 positive cells) of CFRD patients. In conclusion, CFRD is characterized by altered lipid metabolism, insulin deficiency and insulin resistance, partially overlapping with both T1DM and T2DM. CFRD also involves ectopic lung lipids accumulation correlating with increased <i>in situ<\/i> inflammation."

Here, we report long-term outcomes through week 52. This was a randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, phase 3 international trial, conducted at 83 study centers across Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, India, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Republic of Korea, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, and Ukraine. Adults (aged\u2009\u2265\u200918 years) diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, with diabetic macular edema involving the center of the macula, were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P42 or reference aflibercept (2\u00a0mg in 0.05 mL) by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (five doses), then every 8 weeks (four doses), over a 52-week study period. Study data were collected from July 2021 to April 2023. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of CT-P42 compared with reference aflibercept were evaluated until week 52. Overall, 306 participants (CT-P42, 153; reference aflibercept, 153) completed the study through week 52. The primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity through week 8 was reported previously. Improvements in best corrected visual acuity were maintained throughout and were similar between CT-P42 and reference aflibercept, with mean (standard deviation) change from baseline at week 52 of 12.1 (8.9) versus 11.1 (9.9) letters, respectively. Changes from baseline in central subfield thickness and other secondary efficacy endpoints as well as safety endpoints, including treatment-emergent adverse events and immunogenicity, were comparable between groups through week 52. Results through week 52 support the therapeutic equivalence between CT-P42 and reference aflibercept by demonstrating comparable long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.

This study aimed to assess the association between TGF-\u03b21 gene variants and T1DM, as well as its neuropathy, in the Algerian population. A case-control study was conducted, analyzing 344 blood samples. The TGF-\u03b21 rs1800470 and rs1800471 were genotyped using the PCR-SSP method. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared among participants, and phenotype-genotype interactions were determined.The results revealed that the TGF-\u03b21 rs1800470 CC genotype was significantly more frequent in patients (OR\u2009=\u20092.08, p\u2009=\u20090.016), while the GC genotype was significantly more frequent in controls (OR\u2009=\u20090.49, p\u2009=\u20090.001). The C allele (OR\u2009=\u20092.97, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and the GC genotype (OR\u2009=\u20092.93, p\u2009=\u20090.0003) of the TGF-\u03b21 rs1800471 were significantly more frequent in T1DM patients, while the G allele (OR\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and GG genotype (OR\u2009=\u20090.32, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) were more frequent in controls.

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver, which contribute to hepatocellular damage. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this process remain poorly understood. ADAMTS-13, a metalloprotease involved in vascular homeostasis, has been implicated in tissue remodeling and apoptosis. This study explores the potential link between ADAMTS-13 and apoptosis in T1DM-induced liver injury. Diabetes was induced in Wistar albino rats via streptozotocin (STZ) injection, and liver tissues were examined using immunohistochemical staining for ADAMTS-13 and apoptotic markers, including caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and TNFR1. Expression levels were compared between diabetic and control groups to assess correlations with apoptotic pathways. ADAMTS-13 expression was significantly elevated in the diabetic group. Apoptotic markers also showed a significant increase (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Notably, caspase-9 expression was more prominent in hepatocytes, indicating activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, while caspase-8 and TNFR1 were predominantly expressed in sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells, suggesting involvement of the extrinsic pathway. This study is the first to demonstrate a link between ADAMTS-13 expression and apoptosis in T1DM-related liver injury. These findings suggest that ADAMTS-13 may play a role in modulating apoptotic responses, although its exact function remains to be clarified. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to determine whether ADAMTS-13 directly influences apoptosis or represents an adaptive response to hepatic stress. Additionally, the results highlight the potential of ADAMTS-13 as a biomarker for diabetes-associated liver dysfunction."

        "Abstract":"Laparoscopic surgery is being increasingly used for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs). Although laparoscopic regular pancreatectomy (LRP) is frequently performed, laparoscopic enucleation (LE), a parenchyma-sparing technique, may be better in preserving pancreatic endocrine function. However, limited evidence is available regarding the long-term oncological and endocrine outcomes of these two laparoscopic methods. This study aimed to compare the surgical and prognostic outcomes and endocrine function preservation in patients undergoing LE and LRP for well-differentiated, non-invasive PanNEN. This retrospective cohort study included 67 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for small (<\u20092\u00a0cm) well-differentiated PanNEN at Tohoku University Hospital between January 2001 and December 2021. LE was performed for small tumors (<\u20092\u00a0cm) located away (>\u20093\u00a0mm) from the main pancreatic duct. Clinical characteristics, surgical details, tumor characteristics, postoperative complications, recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and long-term endocrine function were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical comparisons. The median follow-up was 78.1\u00a0months for LRP and 135.4\u00a0months for LE. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the operative time, blood loss, or postoperative complications. Five-year RFS was excellent and comparable in both groups (LE, 100%, LRP 96.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.313). Notably, LE was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) compared to LRP (5-year cumulative incidence: 9.1% vs. 43.2%; P\u2009=\u20090.0181). Multivariate analysis identified LRP (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20097.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.03-57.8; P\u2009=\u20090.0469), older age (>\u200960\u00a0years) (HR\u2009=\u20094.49, 95% CI 1.62-12.4; P\u2009=\u20090.0039), and non-functional tumor (HR\u2009=\u20092.78, 95% CI 1.08-7.19; P\u2009=\u20090.0342) as independent predictors of NODM. Given appropriate patient selection, LE of small well-differentiated PanNENs provides comparable oncological outcomes, perioperative safety, and superior long-term endocrine function preservation compared to LRP."

The study describes the additional challenges faced by them during the COVID-19 period and their leadership role in delivering care services to people with diabetes during COVID-19. Research methods comprise semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with ASHAs, individuals with T2DM, and community leaders from August 2021 to July 2023. The study tools were developed based on framework of the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis revealed three main themes, describing challenges faced by ASHAs in COVID-19 management- overburdening of ASHAs, unsafe working conditions and social stigma in communities; COVID-19 impact on people with diabetes mellitus; and leadership demonstrated by ASHAs. The pandemic served as a critical event that foregrounded the role of ASHAs as crucial in mitigating the impacts of the disease, resulting in increasing trust between ASHAs and impacted communities. The results, thus, highlight a potential opportunity to enable and support ASHAs better to improve the reach of primary health-care services in India overall. Research study is original. This research reveals vital role of ASHAs leadership in the context of health-care delivery and contributing to the battle fighting against pandemic while rendering services in the socially disadvantaged communities during COVID-19 pandemic."

Regarding the different aetiology of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in younger individuals compared with the elderly, we investigated the linkage between smoking and the risk of SCA in young-aged adults. In this retrospective analysis, an observational longitudinal cohort was obtained from the national health screening database in South Korea. Adults aged between 20 and 39 years who underwent health screening from 2009 to 2012 were included. Smoking status was categorized as non-smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers. The burden of smoking was classified as mild (<10 pack-years), moderate (<20 pack-years), and heavy smokers (\u226520 pack-years). The primary outcome was the occurrence of SCA during follow-up. Among 6 293 672 individuals, the mean age was 30.8 years, and the median follow-up duration was 9.7 years. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidaemia were rare. Non-smokers were most prevalent (55.2%), followed by current smokers (34.8%) and ex-smokers (10.1%). The incidence of SCA increased from non-smokers (0.06 per 1000 person-years), ex-smokers (0.08), to current smokers (0.14). Current smokers showed increased risk of SCA compared with non-smokers (adjusted hazard ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.57-1.81, P < 0.001). The risk of SCA was not increased in ex-smokers (0.96, 0.86-1.07, P = 0.420). Higher smoking burden was associated with accelerated risk of SCA (adjusted hazard ratio in heavy smokers 2.15, 1.90-2.43, P < 0.001). In young-aged adults, current smoking was associated with significantly increased risk of SCA in long-term follow-up.

To remedy this shortcoming, KALVAP was modified according to the distinctive features of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, yielding nine novel peptides. The DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the peptides was further verified in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activities of WALVAP and WPLVAP were respectively 6.25- and 3.52-fold higher than that of KALVAP (360.39\u2009\u00b1\u200914.39\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009L<sup>-1<\/sup>) after screening through molecular docking.

        "Abstract":"Adolescence is a period of rapid transformation when meeting targets for optimal diabetes care is often challenging due to competing life demands. For more than two decades a diabetes transition clinic in Sydney, Australia, has sustained positive outcomes and demonstrated aspects of resilience in the care of individuals living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who have transitioned from paediatric to adult care. Many studies have focused on resilience in acute care setting showever, studies that examine the factors that support resilience in settings that care for individuals with long-term, chronic conditions such as T1D are lacking. This study aims to examine the contributions of relationships among stakeholders, including adolescents and young adults living with T1D, their carers and healthcare providers, to the resilience of a T1D transition clinic. Clinic observations at a paediatric clinic (transition preparation) and a T1D transition clinic located in an adult hospital, and interviews with eight providers comprising endocrinologists, diabetes educators, nurses and an administrator, and 17 adolescents\/young adults (aged 16-25 years) living with T1D were conducted. Inductive and deductive analyses were performed using a framework of seven principles for Patient and Stakeholder Involvement in Resilience in Healthcare. There was evidence for all seven principles though three were strongly expressed in the data: (1) Individual factors, (2) Influence of leadership and (3) Relationships among young adults, carers, and healthcare providers. Overall, key contributions to the clinic's resilience included a stable and cohesive team, continuity of staff, strong leadership sustained over 20 years, presence of a clinic coordinator, open channels of communication, and a positive, supportive culture among clinic stakeholders. There was also evidence of situational resilience and established processes that were adapted to suit an individuals' needs such as transition timing, mode of service (e.g., telehealth) and appointment time (e.g., after hours). Resilience in transitional care settings such as those that support young adults living with T1D are contingent on person-centred care, relational leadership, and strong and supportive relationships. Similar transitional care clinics could seek to test this model in different contexts to assess the transferability of the findings described here."

        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 14% of pregnancies globally, with rising incidence depending on the diagnostic criteria used. In the UK, screening relies on risk factors at booking, followed by a diagnosis via an oral glucose tolerance test in the second trimester. This approach may lack sensitivity and has poor tolerability. Emerging evidence suggests that GDM pathophysiology begins in the first trimester, with biomarkers showing potential for early prediction. Identifying these could enable earlier risk stratification, improved diagnostic pathways, and better maternal-fetal outcomes. This scoping review maps the existing literature on first-trimester biomarkers of GDM to evaluate their clinical utility and integration into predictive models. A literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, and PubMed to identify studies on first-trimester biomarkers of GDM. Inclusion criteria included (1) studies investigating biomarkers at <15\u2009weeks' gestation; (2) studies that diagnosed GDM using an OGTT with recognized diagnostic guidelines or clearly stated glucose thresholds. A total of 133 studies were included, reporting a wide range of biomarkers (145 in total). PAPP-A was generally lower in GDM, with mixed findings for \u03b2-hCG and PlGF. Metabolic markers, including lipid profiles, fasting glucose, and HbA1c, were often elevated. Inflammatory markers, such as WCC, neutrophils, and CRP, were higher in those later diagnosed with GDM. First-trimester biomarkers highlight GDM's complex pathophysiology. PAPP-A shows predictive potential, while metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers suggest early systemic dysfunction. Emerging tools like 3D ultrasonography indicate placental structural changes. Larger studies are needed to validate these biomarkers and integrate them into predictive models to improve maternal-fetal outcomes."

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided PRF treatment of the PTN on pain scores using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had pharmacotherapy-resistant PDPN. The secondary aims were to evaluate the impact of PRF on sleep quality using the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), assess neuropathic pain severity using the PainDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ), and determine the incidence of procedure-related adverse events. US-guided PTN-PRF provided effective pain reduction at both 1 and 3 months compared with baseline. The VAS score reduction rate was 62.5% at 1 month and 37.5% at 3 months post-treatment. PTN-PRF improved sleep disorders by providing pain control. The JSS score reduction rate was 43.75% at 1 month and 25% at 3 months after treatment.

However, modified MPI was not associated with NICU admission or RDS (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Elevated modified MPI and ICT in diabetic pregnancies may reflect subclinical fetal cardiac dysfunction, although they do not predict short-term adverse neonatal outcomes. Further prospective research is needed to establish the clinical utility of fetal modified MPI for risk stratification in diabetic pregnancies."

        "Abstract":"It is uncertain whether subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) contributes to intrinsic renal dysfunction in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. To investigate whether SCH persisting over 4 years is associated with incident impairment of renal function in people with type 2 diabetes. Longitudinal observational study. Urban population of people with type 2 diabetes living in the community and enrolled in a prospective observational study of diabetes. 725 without known thyroid dysfunction at baseline and at follow-up. Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) in participants stratified by thyroid status at baseline and follow-up into those with euthyroidism or transient or persistent subclinical (SCH)\/overt hypothyroidism. After a mean \u00b1 standard deviation 4.3 \u00b1 0.4 years, 683 participants had stable euthyroidism, 18 transient SCH\/overt hypothyroidism and 24 persistent SCH\/overt hypothyroidism. No significant changes in (\u0394) eGFR were observed in any group. Those with persistent SCH\/overt hypothyroidism demonstrated a significant increase in ACR which was not seen in those with euthyroidism and transient SCH\/overt hypothyroidism (\u0394ACR 22.0 \u00b1 81.4 vs 0.4 \u00b1 36.7 and -0.3 \u00b1 5.7\u2005mg\/mmol respectively, P = 0.027). Similar results were seen when those with baseline ACR > 30\u2005mg\/mmol were excluded. Persistent SCH\/overt hypothyroidism was associated with incident increased albuminuria not observed in euthyroid participants. Assessment of thyroid function in all patients with T2DM may be indicated, as some previous studies provide evidence that thyroxine replacement may ameliorate albuminuria."

        "Abstract":"Fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) are crucial for androgen production during fetal development. Their differentiation from progenitor cells is regulated by various factors, including Desert Hedgehog (DHH), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), and the transcription factor Ad4BP\/SF-1 (NR5A1). Our previous research revealed significant upregulation of energy metabolism genes during FLC differentiation; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unresolved. The current study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms. Through transcriptome analysis, CUT&RUN-seq, and metabolic activity assays, we demonstrated that DHH and PDGF rapidly activate energy metabolism in interstitial cells, involving the FLC progenitor cells, without altering gene expression. In contrast, Ad4BP\/SF-1 sustains high metabolic activity in differentiated FLCs through transcriptional activation. Reporter gene assays revealed that GLI1\/GLI2, activated by DHH signaling, upregulates Ad4BP\/SF-1 gene expression, suggesting a key role for DHH in FLC differentiation. Additionally, DHH signaling activates cholesterogenic gene expression possibly through upregulation of Srebf2 gene. These findings uncover two distinct mechanisms of metabolism regulation by DHH in progenitor cells: a gene regulation-independent control of energy metabolism and a gene regulation-dependent modulation of cholesterogenesis. Furthermore, our results underscore the pivotal role of Ad4BP\/SF-1 in maintaining metabolic activity in FLCs. This study provides novel insights into the regulation of energy and cholesterol metabolisms during FLC differentiation, contributing to a deeper understanding of reproductive system development."

A total of 121 CP patients admitted to Qinhuangdao Hospital of Peking University Third Hospital from March 2021 to March 2024 were selected. According to the severity of the disease, the patients were divided into mild-to-moderate group(n=85) and severe group(n=36). The levels of miR-146a-5p, PI3K and Akt in gingival crevicular fluid were detected, and probing depth(PD), clinical attachment loss(CAL), sulcus bleeding index(SBI) were collected to analyze the factors affecting the severity of CP. Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to analyze the predictive value of miR-146a-5p, PI3K and Akt in CP severity. The miR-146a-5p, PI3K, Akt, probing depth(PD), the level of clinical attachment loss (CAL), the ratio of combined diabetes and the smoking history in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the mild-moderate group(P\uff1c0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes mellitus(OR=3.252, 95%CI: 1.312-8.059), miR-146a-5p level(OR=5.273, 95%CI: 2.469-11.258), PI3K level (OR=4.877, 95%CI: 1.812-13.123) and Akt level (OR=4.421, 95%CI: 1.669-11.710) were independent risk factors affecting the severity of the disease(P\uff1c0.05).

        "Abstract":"Despite achieving complete revascularization, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) may experience adverse outcomes, potentially attributable to coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). Coronary flow reserve (CFR), which integrates both epicardial and microvascular coronary function, and a reduced CFR following complete revascularization indicates the presence of CMD. This study aimed to measure CFR in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for complete revascularization using myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and analyzed the prevalence of CMD and its correlation factors. The clinical data of patients admitted to TEDA International Cardiovascular Hospital between March 2020 and March 2022 were collected. CFR was assessed using MPI. Coronary angiography confirmed successful PCI-defined revascularization. CMD was defined as CFR\u2009<\u20092.0 in any of the three coronary arteries. Logistic regression model was established to analyze the factors associated with CMD. A total of 301 patients were included. Among the enrolled patients, the incidence of CMD was 43.9% (132\/301). Univariate analysis identified clinical presentation, prior myocardial infarction, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperlipidemia, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor\/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI\/ARB) and the number of stents implanted as associated with CMD. Multivariate analysis identified acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (OR\u2009=\u20094.187 95% CI:1.291-13.586), T2DM (OR\u2009=\u20091.878 95% CI: 1.120-3.149) and hyperlipidemia (OR\u2009=\u20091.970 95% CI:1.177-3.299) as independent predictors of CMD. CMD is prevalent following PCI, particularly in patients presenting with AMI or having comorbidities like T2DM and hyperlipidemia. Post-PCI CFR assessment is crucial, and strategies to prevent CMD in the peri-procedural period warrant consideration."

The control group regularly received the lifestyle interventions. The intervention group received the same interventions based on mIoT. Data on glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism were collected at 4\u2009weeks and 8\u2009weeks after the intervention and pre-delivery at the admission. Maternal and infant outcomes were compared between the two groups. After the intervention, the fast blood glucose (FBG) and weight gain in the intervention group were significantly decreased than those in the control group. The glucose-metabolism indexes and lipid metabolism indexes were significantly lower in the intervention group than the control group. The rates of preeclampsia, preterm birth, neonatal hypoglycemia, and fetal macrosomia were also significantly lower in the intervention group than those in the control group. The lifestyle intervention based on the medical Internet of things could improve the compliance and effectiveness of self-management in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, and it had a good clinical effect on their metabolic status in terms of blood glucose and lipids in late pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Interventions in preventive cardiology traditionally focus on four standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (SMuRFs): hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Yet, a substantial proportion of incident cardiovascular events accrues for individuals with none of these factors, particularly among women for whom cardiovascular disease remains under-detected and under-treated. The utility of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was evaluated to detect cardiovascular risk in SMuRF-less women participating in the prospective NIH-funded Women's Health Study. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured at baseline among 12 530 initially healthy American women with no standard modifiable risk factors who were followed over 30 years for first major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, ischaemic stroke, or cardiovascular death). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for incident coronary heart disease (CHD), ischaemic stroke, and total cardiovascular events were calculated across quintiles of hsCRP, along with 30-year cumulative incidence curves. Hazard ratios were also computed according to common clinical thresholds of hsCRP, according to standard deviation change in hsCRP, and as a continuous variable in penalized spline regression models. During 30-year follow-up, 973 first major cardiovascular events accrued. Median baseline hsCRP was significantly higher among SMuRF-less women who subsequently suffered a cardiovascular event when compared with those who did not (median hsCRP 2.22 vs 1.50\u2005mg\/L, P < .0001). In age-adjusted analyses, the HRs for the primary endpoint of incident CHD from lowest (referent) to highest levels of hsCRP at study entry were 1.0 (referent), 1.24, 1.41, 1.57, and 2.23 (P-trend < .0001) such that CHD risk over 30 years increased 21% for each increasing quintile of hsCRP (age-adjusted HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.29, P < .0001). Corresponding HRs for the top vs bottom quintile of hsCRP were 1.69 (95% CI 1.16-2.47) for ischaemic stroke and 1.74 (95% CI 1.42-2.14) for total cardiovascular disease events. Using common clinical hsCRP thresholds, SMuRF-less women with hsCRP > 3\u2005mg\/L had a 77% higher risk of CHD events, a 39% higher risk of ischaemic stroke events, and a 52% higher risk of total cardiovascular disease events when compared with those with hsCRP < 1\u2005mg\/L. Spline analyses demonstrated linear association with risk across the spectrum of hsCRP values. Hazards were moderately attenuated after additional adjustment for body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate [covariate-adjusted CHD HR 1.86 (95% CI 1.35-2.58, P = .0002) for comparison of the top vs bottom quintile of hsCRP and 1.52 (95% CI 1.20-1.92, P = .0006) for comparison of those with hsCRP > 3\u2005mg\/L to those < 1\u2005mg\/L]. Over a 30-year horizon, cardiovascular events commonly occur among 'SMuRF-less but inflamed' women who are otherwise missed by current screening algorithms, a clinically important observation given recent trial data demonstrating that statin therapy reduces risk by 38% among such individuals."

Among sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) patients, multi-morbidity contributes to poor clinical outcomes, yet its prevalence and associated risk factors remain under-explored. This study examines the prevalence of multi-morbidity among SA-AKI patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting and identifies significant risk factors that influence outcomes. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 185 adult ICU patients with SA-AKI in a tertiary intensive care unit between January 2023 and January 2024. Risk factors, biochemical profiles, and clinical outcomes were analysed. Logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of multi-morbidity. Results Among 185 SA-AKI patients, the prevalence of multi-morbidity was 38.9 per cent, with older age [\u226560 yr, adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 22.11, P<0.0001), chloride imbalance (AOR: 0.42, P=0.023), and albumin imbalance (AOR: 0.10, P=0.018) identified as significant risk factors. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (52.4%) and diabetes mellitus (46.5%). Electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia (34.1%) and hypoalbuminemia (77.8%) were prevalent. Patients with multimorbidity had higher mechanical ventilation rates (62.5% vs. 28.3%) and hospital mortality rates (60.6% vs. 23.5%, P<0.001). Renal replacement therapy use was not significantly different between groups. Interpretation & conclusions The study highlights the high burden of multi-morbidity in SA-AKI patients, with significant implications for clinical management and outcomes. Comprehensive strategies are needed to address the associated risk factors and improve care in this population."

        "Abstract":"While the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the pediatric population has been increasing dramatically in recent years, most youths with T1D do not meet the treatment targets recommended by the American Diabetes Association. The multiple self-report scales for parents and adolescents that have been investigated in relation to treatment adherence and glycemic control in pediatric T1D show limited predictive abilities. This longitudinal observational study investigates whether the Global Assessment of Relational Functioning (GARF) can predict the medical outcome for newly diagnosed youths with T1D. The GARF is a brief structured interview assessing important areas of family functioning. The GARF assesses three main areas of family functioning: The organization, the emotional climate, and the problem-solving attributes of the family. Fifty-one youths recently diagnosed with diabetes and their families were recruited from a care facility in Canada. The age of the youths ranged from 1 to 16\u2009years (M\u2009=\u20098.89; SD\u2009=\u20094.2), comprising 13 preschoolers, 28 school-aged children, and 10 teenagers. Including family members, a total of 139 people participated in the assessments. Correlations were sought between GARF scores, patients' serum glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the frequency of ER visits, hospitalizations, episodes of ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia, insulin resistance, and mental health referrals over 21\u2009months. The GARF score was significantly inversely correlated with outcome HbA1c scores (r\u2009=\u2009-0.61, p\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating that higher family functioning is associated with better metabolic control. These results suggest the GARF could be administered at diagnosis to predict diabetes outcome among a pediatric population."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced in Wistar rats through a high-fat diet followed by streptozotocin administration. Rats were assigned to each of the six groups: control, control + CA (40 mg kg<sup>-1<\/sup>), T2DM, T2DM + CA (20 mg kg<sup>-1<\/sup>), T2DM + CA (40 mg kg<sup>-1<\/sup>), and T2DM + CA (40 mg kg<sup>-1<\/sup>) with brusatol (an Nrf2 inhibitor; 2 mg per kg per twice per week). Over 8 weeks, we assessed metabolic parameters, serum lipid profiles, renal function, oxidative stress markers, and kidney histology. CA did not significantly affect the body weight or insulin levels in T2DM rats. Nevertheless, it notably reduced the fasting glucose levels and improved the renal function, as evidenced by reductions in serum creatinine and urinary albumin levels. CA treatment significantly decreased the expression of renal inflammatory markers TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and nuclear NF-\u03baB in the kidneys of T2DM rats. Furthermore, CA reduced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the lower MDA levels and elevated antioxidant marker levels (GSH, SOD, and HO-1) in the kidneys of both control and T2DM rats. CA treatment increased the nuclear Nrf2 levels and decreased the transcription and cytoplasmic Keap1 levels, with the levels of these effects being dose-dependent between 20 and 40 mg kg<sup>-1<\/sup>. The addition of brusatol reversed the beneficial effects of CA, underscoring the pivotal role of Nrf2 in mediating CA's protective actions.

We used administrative claims data from Scotland collected at the Tayside Health Informatics Centre and selected patients between 1 January and 30 June 2020 with underlying conditions of HF, CKD and\/or DM. The follow-up time of each patient was divided into assessment periods to predict a patient's maximum potassium value within the next 4\u2009weeks (prediction periods). Three linear mixed-effect models were fitted and model performance was assessed using root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). Among 5918 patients with a mean age of 76.2\u00a0years, a median of 17.0 potassium concentrations were measured per patient corresponding with 1.71 measurements per assessment period. In total, we predicted 5478 maximum potassium values. The final model performed with a RMSE of 0.52, MAE of 0.39, MSE of 0.27 and no apparent trends in the residuals over time. Prediction was more accurate within the potassium reference range and tended to underestimate extremely high and overestimate low observations. Among the strongest predictors were newly acquired acute kidney injury, last measured potassium and use of low ceiling and high ceiling diuretics. We propose a blueprint of a decision support tool which predicts potassium concentration longitudinally by updating the predictions based on accumulating data. Our findings demonstrate that dynamically reassessing predictors can aid in estimating potassium levels over multiple months with reasonable accuracy in the outpatient setting."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM), a global health issue, is a chronic metabolic disorder that mainly involves glucose homeostasis. It causes different complications, in particular, diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). Pathophysiology of DM and DNP involves mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress. Melatonin is a neurohormone which is mainly released by the pineal gland and demonstrates neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials. Reports indicate the role of melatonin in the modulation of insulin sensitivity and secretion thereby regulating glucose metabolism. Melatonin has also been shown to reduce neuropathic pain by influencing neurodegeneration, inflammation and oxidative stress. This review aims to explore different mechanisms through which melatonin affects DM and DNP so that its potential to be used as a therapeutic agent can be deciphered. Different preclinical and clinical evidence relating to the efficacy of melatonin will be analyzed in this review together with the limitations of using melatonin. The review will also propose some directions for applying these findings to clinical practice. Considering the multidimensional potential of melatonin and its safety, it can be used as a tool to develop therapeutic interventions for the management of DM and DNP."

        "Abstract":"The association between ozone (O<sub>3<\/sub>) exposure and the dynamic and accelerated progression of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remains unclear in elderly individuals with hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), or dyslipidemia. This study included 250,246 participants with HTN, DM, or dyslipidemia from the Guangzhou Older Longitudinal Dynamic Health. Long-term O<sub>3<\/sub> exposure was estimated using bilinear interpolation based on geocoded residential addresses. We employed multi-state models to assess the associations between O<sub>3<\/sub> exposure and transitions from baseline to NCDs (stroke, coronary heart disease, fatty liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease), multimorbidity and death. Accelerated failure time (AFT) models were further used to examine progression acceleration and predict transition times. Over 727,003.2 person-years of follow-up, 99,246 participants (39.66%) developed NCDs, of whom 10,349 (10.43%) progressed to multimorbidity and 5,759 (5.80%) died. We observed that O<sub>3<\/sub> exposure was associated with the dynamic progression of NCDs. Specifically, the hazard ratios (HRs) for each 10 \u03bcg\/m<sup>3<\/sup> increase in O<sub>3<\/sub> were 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38, 1.40] and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.39) for transitions from baseline to NCDs and from NCDs to multimorbidity. AFT analyses demonstrated that O<sub>3<\/sub> exposure could accelerate the progression of NCDs, for example, shortening the transition time from baseline to NCDs from 3.61 years at 80 \u03bcg\/m<sup>3<\/sup> to 1.31 years at 130 \u03bcg\/m<sup>3<\/sup>. These findings suggest that O<sub>3<\/sub> exposure might be an important risk factor for both the dynamic and accelerated progressions of NCDs among elderly populations with HTN, DM, or dyslipidemia."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus affects the functions of large and small vessels, leading to complications broadly classified as macro-vascular complications, including peripheral arterial disease, heart disease, and stroke, and microvascular complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Moreover, vascular dysfunction, including abnormal reactivity to endogenous substances, is often observed in patients with diabetes mellitus. Among various vasoactive substances, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), which was first isolated from peripheral blood >70 years ago, plays a pivotal role in the vascular system. However, the role of 5-HT-mediated vascular function, including vasoconstriction, in diabetes mellitus-associated vascular complications remains unclear. In addition to the abnormal 5-HT responsiveness observed in patients with diabetes mellitus, 5-HT also contributes to diabetes-associated vasculopathy through its role in vascular wall remodeling. In this review, we first summarize the altered responses and downstream signaling pathways induced by 5-HT in large and small vessels in animal models of diabetes mellitus and in patients based on evidence from the past 30 years. We also discuss the effects of sarpogrelate, a 5-HT<sub>2A<\/sub> receptor antagonist, on vascular function in diabetes mellitus and highlight the importance of blocking vascular 5-HT<sub>2A<\/sub> receptors as an approach to mitigate diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction. Our overarching aim is to emphasize the importance of controlling 5-HT-mediated signaling in the vasculature to prevent and treat diabetes-associated vascular complications."

        "Abstract":"Guidelines recommend trans-radial access (TRA) for all percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, no randomized trials have shown a lower mortality when compared to the femoral approach in chronic coronary disease and femoral access may be preferred in certain situations. Consecutive eligible patients in a multicentre registry between 2014 - 2020 were included. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between those who underwent radial versus femoral access. The main outcomes were major bleeding and 5-year mortality. Of the 6,158 patients included, 3,784 (61.4%) had TRA and 2,374 (38.6%) femoral access. TRA predominated from 2016. The femoral group had higher rates of diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction and prior stroke. Trans-femoral procedures were more complex with higher rates of ACC\/AHA type B2\/C lesions, chronic total occlusions, left main PCI, use of adjuvants including rotational atherectomy, and lower procedural success rates. Major bleeding was higher in the femoral group (radial 0.4% vs femoral 0.8%, p\u202f=\u202f0.039), however femoral access did not predict major bleeding (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.74-3.82). There was no difference in 5-year mortality (radial 20.3% vs femoral 21%, p\u202f=\u202f0.65). In conclusion, TRA predominates in contemporary PCI for CCD. The femoral group had higher procedural complexity and risk with a higher incidence of peri-procedural major bleeding. Nonetheless, femoral access did not predict major bleeding and there was no difference in 5-year mortality as compared to TRA. In the absence of a contemporary randomized trial, the femoral approach appears reasonable if clinically preferred in patients with chronic coronary disease undergoing PCI."

        "Abstract":"While diet has been regarded as a potential environmental risk factor for psoriasis, the precise contribution of specific dietary components, such as sugar, to its pathogenesis remains uncertain. Metformin, a primary medication for type II diabetes mellitus, has been documented to yield improvements in psoriasis. Earlier research indicates that the anti-hyperglycemic impact of metformin is associated with changes in gut microbiota. Nonetheless, the role of gut microbiota in the anti-psoriatic effects of metformin remains unclear. Herein, we showed that 4 weeks of glucose intake exacerbated PsD in mice, which resolved with oral metformin treatment. The exacerbation and resolution of PsD were mediated through effects on the gut microbiota. Supplementation with A. muciniphila, enriched by metformin, or Amuc_1100 improved PsD in glucose-fed mice but not in the control mice. Glucose intake resulted in reduced serum levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a microbial tryptophan metabolite, which were reversed by A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100 treatment. Oral feeding and local injection of IAA protected mice from glucose-promoted PsD with suppressed expression of antimicrobial peptides, specifically S100A8, in the epidermis. Collectively, increases of A. muciniphila through metformin treatment led to reversal of glucose-promoted PsD in mice, possibly through production of the microbial tryptophan metabolite IAA."

        "Abstract":"Emerging adulthood (aged 18-29\u2009years) is a critical period marked by social, academic, and work transitions. During this life stage, sleep patterns are easily changed, especially for those who live with type 1 diabetes mellitus, which increases the likelihood of sleep disorders. We sought to (1) describe sleep characteristics in emerging adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Andalusia, Spain; (2) determine the prevalence of insomnia and hypersomnolence using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria; and (3) examine the relationship between sociodemographic factors and diabetes-related factors with sleep satisfaction and symptoms of insomnia and hypersomnolence while controlling for potential confounders such as coexisting health conditions and the use of sleep aids. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Andalusia, Spain, from October 2021 to July 2022, involving 362 emerging adults aged 18 to 29 (67.4% female) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Participants completed online forms for sociodemographic questions and the Oviedo Sleep Questionnaire. The average sleep duration was 6.8\u2009hours, with half of the participants expressing dissatisfaction. Sleep duration and biological sex predicted insomnia and hypersomnolence, while only sleep duration predicted sleep satisfaction. Common nocturnal awakenings were due to urination, noise, and hyper\/hypoglycemia. Notably, 47.5% met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia and 6.9% for hypersomnolence. Emerging adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Andalusia frequently faced significant sleep challenges, including sleep dissatisfaction, insufficient sleep duration, insomnia, and hypersomnolence. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive sleep assessments in diabetes care, using DSM-5 criteria that can guide interventions to improve sleep quality and glycemic stability."

        "Abstract":"Neointimal hyperplasia is a key pathology in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) vascular complications. It involves phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) triggered by hyperglycemia, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We employed Twist1 vascular smooth muscle-specific knockout mice with carotid artery ligation in a T2DM model to study Twist1's role in diabetic neointimal hyperplasia. In vitro, we examined how hyperglycemia via Pkc\u03b2\/Ikk\u03b2\/Nf-\u03bab pathway affects Twist1's regulation of contractile proteins, matrix molecules, cell morphology, migration, and proliferation in rat VSMCs using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, wound healing assays, and EdU incorporation. Co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization assessed how Twist1-p300 interaction under high glucose affects Myocardin-Srf binding. Twist1 was significantly upregulated in VSMCs of T2DM mice. Vascular smooth muscle-specific Twist1 knockout reduced neointimal formation after vascular injury in T2DM. High glucose activated Pkc\u03b2\/Ikk\u03b2\/Nf-\u03bab pathway, promoting Twist1 upregulation and nuclear translocation, decreasing contractile protein expression while increasing matrix molecules and VSMC proliferation\/migration. Mechanistically, upregulated Twist1 increased p300 binding, blocking p300's transcriptional co-activation of Myocardin\/Srf and inhibiting contractile gene transcription in VSMCs. Hyperglycemia activates the PKC\u03b2\/IKK\u03b2\/NF-\u03baB pathway, upregulating Twist1 and promoting its nuclear translocation. Twist1 binding to p300 inhibits Myocardin\/SRF-mediated contractile gene transcription, leading to VSMC phenotypic switching and neointimal hyperplasia. These findings highlight Twist1 as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic vascular complications."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes is one of the most common chronic health threats worldwide. Early detection of diabetes is difficult and diagnosis and treatment processes can be costly. Data mining techniques offer powerful tools for predictive analysis and knowledge extraction from large data sets. This study aims to identify symptoms that collectively influence the development of diabetes by data mining and identify risk parameters for early detection. The study uses a dataset of 520 patient records collected from Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh. This dataset is based on real-world data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Apriori algorithm, which is widely used in data mining, was applied to analyze the symptoms associated with diabetes using association analysis. The algorithm analyzed the relationships between symptoms based on support, confidence and lift values. The analysis identified eight key symptoms that significantly contribute to diabetes risk when they occur together: gender, polyuria, polydipsia, sudden weight loss, weakness, blurred vision, partial paresis and obesity. The co-occurrence of these symptoms increases the likelihood of developing diabetes by 1.63 times. These findings emphasize the importance of assessing symptoms collectively rather than in isolation. The results of the study emphasize the importance of individuals at risk of diabetes and healthcare professionals to monitor these symptoms and take necessary precautions. The study shows that association rule mining, especially the Apriori algorithm, is a valuable tool for identifying symptom associations and facilitating early diabetes detection. The findings will contribute to early detection of diabetes and prevention of complications related to the disease through simple symptom analysis."

Limited data are available on the prognostic value of cardiac MRI in DM. We aimed to evaluate the association between MRI-derived strain analysis and adverse outcomes in DM patients at different heart failure (HF) stages. In this prospective study, DM participants with preserved ejection fraction (EF) underwent MRI examination between January 2019 and December 2021 were evaluated. Feature tracking strain parameters were measured using cine MRI. The primary outcome was a composite outcome including HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death. Cox proportional regression was used to assess the association between risk factors and outcomes. A total of 581 DM participants (mean age, 56\u00a0years\u2009\u00b1\u200913; 401 men) including 390 asymptomatic patients (stage A\/B HF) and 191 heart failure with preserved EF were evaluated. After a median follow-up of 34.3\u00a0months, 74 DM patients reached the primary outcome; 13(2.2%) had cardiovascular mortality and 61(10.5%) had heart failure hospitalization. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with global longitudinal strain (GLS) greater than or equal to -13.76% and patients with global\u00a0early diastolic longitudinal strain rate (eGLSR) less than or equal to 0.51\/s were more likely to experience the primary outcome (log-rank P\u2009<\u20090.001). In multivariable analysis, eGLSR was independently associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint(per SD, adjusted HR: 2.038; 95% CI: 1.384-3.002; P\u2009<\u20090.001), but GLS was not. When risk stratification was based on GLS and eGLSR, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with abnormal eGLSR had a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes, regardless of GLS status. In addition, eGLSR provided incremental predictive power over clinical and imaging variables, achieving the largest C-statistic of 0.744. Of note, the association between eGLSR and outcomes was consistent in stage A\/B HF patients and patients with HFpEF. Subgroup analysis showed non-ischemic LGE assessed by MRI was also independently associated with outcomes in patients with DM. In DM patients with preserved ejection fraction, left ventricular eGLSR measured by cardiac MRI was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes and offered incremental prognostic value over conventional clinical and imaging indices."

This study used data from the Thai National Health Examination Surveys in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2020 to estimate the overall prevalence and trends of diabetes, diagnosed, treated, and controlled diabetes. We also used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the factors related to the prevalence of diabetes, as well as diagnosed, treated, and controlled diabetes, in the 2020 survey cycle. Following the global trends, age- and sex-standardized prevalence of diabetes in Thailand increased from 7.5% (95%CI: 6.5, 8.5) in 2004 to 10.1% (95%CI: 9.0, 11.1) in 2020; only 62.8% (95%CI: 59.9, 65.8) were aware of their diagnosis, 42.9% (95%CI: 39.0, 46.9) were treated, and only 20.5% (95%CI: 17.8, 23.1) had controlled blood glucose levels. Individuals in younger age groups and lower socioeconomic status were more likely to be independently associated with unawareness, untreated, and uncontrolled diabetes. These findings underscore the importance of addressing the awareness, treatment, and control gaps in diabetes management in Thai adults. Strengthening diabetes prevention and management requires a comprehensive approach for individuals, communities, and the health system, including improved screening strategies, enhanced lifestyle modification, treatment practices, multidisciplinary collaboration, and resource allocation."

However, the combined relationship and synergistic effect on the risk of diabetes in middle-aged and elderly people are still unclear. Using nationally representative data collected between 2011 and 2020 by the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Dynapenic abdominal obesity was a measure that combined hand grip strength and waist circumference. 7934 participants aged\u2009\u2265\u200945 years were divided into four groups\u00a0(neither dynapenia nor abdominal obesity, only dynapenia, only abdominal obesity, and dynapenic abdominal obesity). Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the association of dynapenic abdominal obesity on diabetes. The reference group comprised participants with neither dynapenia nor abdominal obesity. Dynapenic abdominal obesity was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (HR\u2009=\u20091.52; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.12-2.05). Only abdominal obesity group also had a higher risk of diabetes (HR\u2009=\u20091.54, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.32-1.80), and only dynapenia was not statistically associated with the risk of diabetes (HR\u2009=\u20091.05, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.80-1.39) and sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. Dynapenic abdominal obesity and only abdominal obesity might be associated with 52% and 54% higher risk of diabetes, while only dynapenia was not statistically associated with the risk of diabetes."

        "Abstract":"Our objective was to investigate the potential of lutein in enhancing the efficacy of metformin in diabetes treatment and the underlying mechanisms involved. Here, the study was conducted with type 2 diabetic mice, which was induced by a high-fat diet with streptozotocin. Twenty-four diabetic model mice were divided into four groups: model control group, metformin group, lutein group, and lutein combined with metformin (Lut_Met) group. Six C57BL\/6 mice were assigned to the normal control group and provided a normal chow diet. First, we found that the blood glucose concentration, area of the curve of the oral glucose tolerance test, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and imidazole propionate (ImP) levels of the Lut_Met group were significantly lower than those of the metformin group at the 8th week. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was observed between the reduction in blood glucose and the ImP levels in the Lut_Met group. The Firmicutes\/Bacteroidota ratio in the Lut_Met group was significantly lower than that in the model control and metformin groups. In addition, the abundance of Eggerthella lenta in the Lut_Met group was significantly lower than that in the metformin group and showed a positive relationship with ImP levels. Moreover, compared with the metformin treatment, Lut_Met intervention had a significant impact on the AMPK signaling pathway. Further western blot analyses revealed that the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK\/\u03b2-Actin to AMPK\/\u03b2-Actin in the Lut_Met group was significantly greater than that in the metformin group. In conclusion, lutein has the potential to enhance the favorable effects of metformin on blood glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in a mouse model of diabetes. The underlying mechanisms are likely associated with the modulation of the gut microbiota-ImP axis and AMPK phosphorylation."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM), a metabolic disease of globally health concern, is pathologically attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction, an essential component in disease progression. Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) acts as a critical defense mechanism for metabolic homeostasis, yet its implications in DM and its complications remain incompletely understood. This study thoroughly summarizes emerging evidence that delineates the molecular processes of MQC, with an emphasis on effector protein post-translational regulation, upstream signaling hubs, and interactions with other metabolic processes including ferroptosis and lipid metabolism. We highlight newly discovered processes involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles, licensed mitophagy, and mitocytosis that broaden the regulatory landscape of MQC, going beyond the traditionally recognized process including biogenesis, dynamics and mitophagy. MQC imbalance exacerbates insulin resistance, while impaired insulin signaling reciprocally compromises mitochondrial function, creating a vicious cycle of metabolic deterioration. Despite tissue-specific pathophysiology, diabetic complications exhibit identical MQC impairment including suppressed biogenesis, fission-fusion imbalance, and deficient mitophagy. Emerging therapies including clinical hypoglycemic agents and bioactive phytochemicals demonstrate therapeutic potential by restoring MQC. However, current strategies remain anchored to classical pathways, neglecting novel MQC mechanisms such as mitocytosis. Addressing this gap demands integration of cutting-edge MQC insights into drug discovery, particularly for compounds modulating upstream regulators. Future studies must prioritize mechanistic dissection of MQC novel targets and their translational relevance in halting metabolic collapse of diabetes progression. Since mitochondrial function is a cornerstone of metabolic restoration, synergizing precision MQC modulation with multi-target interventions, holds transformative potential for refine diabetic complications therapeutics."

Global disparities in their access and reimbursement may be associated with glycemic outcomes. To describe how accessibility and reimbursement of advanced diabetes technologies and insulin are associated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in centers participating in the SWEET initiative, an international pediatric diabetes registry. This global multicenter cross-sectional study collected data from 81 centers in 56 countries. Web-based questionnaires were distributed to representatives of all 121 pediatric diabetes centers participating in the SWEET initiative from March 1 to May 31, 2024, and used to map accessibility of and reimbursement for CGM, CSII, glucometers, and insulin. Reimbursement data were compared with HbA1c levels using the SWEET Study dataset. Participants included 42\u202f349 children with T1D. Responses were categorized into 4 groups based on the extent of reimbursement for diabetes technologies and insulin. Mean HbA1c levels across centers calculated from measurements current as of December 31, 2023, analyzed by categories of accessibility of and reimbursement for diabetes technologies and insulin. Data collected from 81 of 121 SWEET centers (67%) across 56 countries included HbA1c levels from 42\u202f349 children with T1D (22\u202f021 male [52%]; mean [SD] age, 14.3 [4.4] years; mean [SD] diabetes duration, 6.0 [4.2] years). Universal access with complete reimbursement for all technologies and insulin was reported by 32 centers from 19 countries, while 8 countries reported no reimbursement for any technologies or insulin. Centers with full reimbursement for CSII, CGM, glucometers, and insulin showed mean HbA1c levels of 7.62% (95% CI, 7.59%-7.64%) to 7.75% (95% CI, 7.73%-7.77%) compared with 9.65% (95% CI, 9.55%-9.71%) to 10.49% (95% CI, 10.40%-10.58%) in centers with no reimbursement and\/or no availability (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for all items).

        "Abstract":"Periodontitis is a chronic, multifactorial inflammatory disease characterized by the progressive destruction of the periodontal supporting tissues, including alveolar bone, potentially resulting in tooth loss. Etiopathogenesis involves a dysbiotic shift in the subgingival microbiota where the presence of pathogenic species such as <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis<\/i>, <i>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans<\/i>, and <i>Treponema denticola<\/i> has been documented. This disbalance is combined with an inadequate host immune response, often exacerbated by other systemic comorbidities including diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Conventional therapy typically comprises mechanical debridement and adjunctive local or systemic antimicrobials, but emerging antibiotic resistance highlights a need for alternative adjuvant therapeutic strategies. The present descriptive analysis of microbiome and clinical trends study evaluated the adjuvant effects of a clinoptilolite-based zeolite material, namely PMA-zeolite, with professional prophylaxis on clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with chronic periodontitis over a 10-week period. Clinical assessment revealed significant reductions in bleeding on probing (BoP) and periodontal pocket depth (PD), indicating improved inflammatory status. Microbiome profiling demonstrated a marked decrease in key periodontal pathogens, suggesting that PMA-zeolite can help rebalance the oral microbiome. These findings suggest that the combined therapy exhibits promising anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, indicating its role in promoting microbial homeostasis and reducing periodontal inflammation. However, further investigation through larger, controlled clinical trials is needed to validate the efficacy of the therapy."

This study investigated the expression of early growth response-1 (EGR1) and its association with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways in the rotator cuff tendons of hyperglycemic swine, a model chosen for its anatomical similarity to humans. Rotator cuff tendon tissues were collected from normal and hyperglycemic swine and analyzed using histology, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Histological evaluation revealed altered tenocyte morphology and increased cellularity in hyperglycemic tendons. qRT-PCR results showed significant transcriptional upregulation of EGR1, TLR4, and NF-\u03baB in hyperglycemic samples, suggesting activation of inflammatory and stress-response pathways. However, protein analysis revealed a non-significant decrease in EGR1 levels and modest increases in TLR4 and NF-\u03baB, indicating possible post-transcriptional regulation. This discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels of EGR1 may be attributed to altered stress granule dynamics under hyperglycemic conditions. These findings elucidate a novel interplay among metabolic stress, innate immune signaling, and translational regulation in tendon tissue, proposing that targeting TLR4 signaling or stress granule formation may offer therapeutic potential for preserving tendon integrity in diabetic patients."

First, diabetes stigma, psychological (anxiety, depression, and distress), behavioral (diet, exercise, blood glucose testing, and foot care), and clinical outcomes (baseline HbA1c) and psychosocial moderators (hope, self-esteem, and social support) were assessed. Second, 3-month post-discharge HbA1c was assessed. Linear regression models were used to analyze data. Diabetes stigma was positively associated with anxiety, depression, and distress. Hope negatively moderated the association between public stigma and anxiety. Hope and self-esteem negatively moderated the associations between diabetes stigma and depression. Social support negatively moderated the association between public stigma and depression. Self-esteem positively moderated the association between self-stigma and distress. Decreasing diabetes stigma can improve psychosocial health among young and middle-aged Chinese patients with T2DM, and interventions targeting hope, self-esteem, and social support can decrease the negative impact of diabetes stigma on psychological outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Stroke and dementia have common modifiable risk factors. Current prevention strategies primarily focus on high-risk populations, leaving a gap in addressing the broader population. We report the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and effectiveness of a polypill (valsartan 80mg, amlodipine 5mg, and rosuvastatin 10mg), with and without use of the Stroke Riskometer app, on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors at 9 months after randomization in a population of low to borderline CVD risk. Prospective, pragmatic, multicentre, factorial, phase III, placebo-controlled, cluster RCT in low to moderate CVD risk (10-year risk <20%) individuals aged 50-75 years with no prior history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, or other CVD, with a SBP of 121-139 mmHg and at least one lifestyle-related CVD risk factor. Primary Care Units in Porto Alegre, Brazil, were centrally randomized to either use of the Stroke Riskometer app or standard care for lifestyle modification. All eligible individuals underwent a 28-day open run-in phase using the active medication. Participants who tolerated and had high adherence were randomized to either polypill or placebo, using a minimization process according to age, sex, SBP, cholesterol, and education level. The dual primary outcomes were change in SBP and Life Simple 7 (LS7) score at 9 months post-randomization. A sample of 354 participants was estimated to provide 80% statistical power (two sided \u03b1=0.05, \u03b2 =0.20) for 6 clusters with intra-cluster correlation of 0.01 to detect a clinically significant 2.5 mmHg (SD\u00b18) difference in SBP change and 0.65 points (SD\u00b11.61) difference in the LS7 score at 9 months post-randomization between the polypill\/Stroke Riskometer group and placebo\/usual care group, assuming 10% lost to follow-up. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. Regression analysis models (ANCOVA) assessed the differences among the four groups concerning changes in SBP, cholesterol levels, cognitive function, and behavioral risk factors over time. The findings will provide critical information to allow the development of primary stroke and CVD prevention strategies in low to borderline CVD risk adults. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT05155137."

        "Abstract":"Foot infections are a common condition that foot and ankle providers treat. For patients who require an amputation, surgeons must decide what level of amputation to perform based on the extent of infection, soft-tissue viability, and the biomechanics of the foot. Although the literature has shown the high risk of repeated ulceration and amputation after a foot ulcer, there has been little published comparing partial first-ray amputation with hallux amputation. The present study looked at reoperation and reamputation rates in 295 patients with either a partial first-ray amputation or a hallux amputation for treatment of infection. Almost half of both groups required a reoperation: 41.1% and 42.9% in the hallux and partial first-ray amputation groups, respectively. There was a 31.9% distal amputation rate in the hallux amputation group and a 27.9% rate in the partial first-ray amputation group. There was found to be a 10.6% and 16.9% major amputation rate in the hallux amputation and partial first-ray amputation groups, respectively. We found no statistically significant differences between these two groups regarding reoperation rates and distal or major amputations. Either procedure is appropriate for infections of the first ray, and the level of amputation should be determined based on the extent of the infection and soft-tissue coverage."

Neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease with external trauma are the main factors of foot ulcers in a diabetic patient. We aimed to investigate the aesthetic, weight, and functional satisfaction of prosthesis use depending on the level of amputation. Forty-four patients were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups after surgery according to level of amputation: below-the-knee (group 1) and above-the-knee (group 2) amputations. Those who had to be operated on again due to wound and stump problems and those who could not use prostheses due to being bedridden were excluded from the study.

The orthoplastic anteromedial incisional approach to the ankle courses between the anterior tibial and posterior tibial angiosomes. There are various modalities that can be used in evaluating the integrity of these angiosomes before surgical intervention. A retrospective review of 23 patients using the anteromedial ankle approach in either total talus replacement or total ankle replacement was performed from January 1, 2016, through August 31, 2021. Surgical intervention occurred from January 29, 2016, through January 10, 2019, and follow-up was through August 2021. Patients were evaluated based on medical history, postoperative week of suture or staple removal, incision complications, and time at which full weightbearing began. Smoking history was also documented. Eighteen patients healed uneventfully, and some of these patients had a smoking history, a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or both. A preoperative evaluation of vascular supply is necessary to determine the healing potential of this approach. Atraumatic handling of the soft-tissue envelope is imperative to aid in wound healing and optimize the postoperative course. The orthoplastic anteromedial ankle incisional approach is a possible alternative option for an anterior ankle incision if adequate vascular status is determined to be present before surgical intervention."

This systematic literature review gathers, organises and evaluates existing qualitative studies investigating or reporting on how diagnosis of T1DM has impacted an individual's identity, and the ongoing impact that diagnosis of T1DM has on an individual's identity. Thematic synthesis of evidence from 13 studies produced four overarching themes: Social Identity; Loss of Self; Rejecting T1DM from Identity; and Acceptance into Identity. Findings highlight that T1DM impacts various aspects of an individual's identity and individuals may respond to this in a range of ways, including struggling to adhere to T1DM management. It is of significant importance that healthcare teams expand the way they think about and work with T1DM, developing appropriate psychological interventions, including conversations about identity and a broader systemic focus on T1DM stigma."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with persistent hyperglycemia, leading to severe complications affecting multiple organs, particularly the liver and wound healing processes. One major factor driving these complications is neutrophil elastase (NE), a protease that plays a pivotal role in inflammation and impaired tissue repair. Despite its crucial involvement, detecting NE activity in vivo has been challenging due to limitations in current detection methods. This study introduces a novel NE-specific probe, NEP, and its self-assembled form, NanoNEP, designed to overcome these challenges. NanoNEP was synthesized by assembling NEP with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to enhance its biocompatibility, solubility, and dispersion. The probe was characterized for its selectivity, stability, and biocompatibility, and demonstrated its ability to monitor NE activity in vivo, specifically in diabetic mice liver, wounds, and serum, as well as in human diabetic foot lesions. These findings highlight the potential of NanoNEP as a sensitive and innovative tool for real-time detection of NE activity, providing valuable insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes-related complications and offering new opportunities for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

However, the specifics of advising and\/or prescribing exercise in patient management may not be taught comprehensively in undergraduate and postgraduate medical curriculum. This study aimed to evaluate primary care physicians' habits in advising and\/or prescribing exercise to their patients. Primary care physicians practising in all public primary care clinics in Singapore were invited via email and posters to participate in an anonymous online questionnaire. The questionnaire explored physicians' habits in advising and\/or prescribing exercise to their patients. Results showed that 95.9% of primary care physicians gave patients advice on exercise. However, only 24.7% prescribed exercise (specific written instructions) to their patients. Time constraint is the top barrier cited by primary care physicians for not giving exercise advice and\/or prescription. The top three conditions for which exercise advice and\/or prescription was given by physicians were diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Physicians who cited insufficient expertise\/knowledge as a barrier were more likely to have never attended an exercise prescription course. Most primary care physicians in Singapore advised exercise as part of the management plan for their patients. However, a much lower proportion gave specific exercise prescription. The most commonly cited barrier to advising or prescribing exercise is time constraint, while lack of expertise or knowledge may stem from not having received relevant training. Future efforts could focus on providing primary care physicians with targeted training to overcome the barrier of insufficient expertise or knowledge in exercise advice and prescription."

Subsequently, the diagnostic and predictive capacity of miR-484 for GDM was assessed utilizing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. In the next phase, the effects of miR-484 on blood glucose levels and insulin resistance in GDM mice were studied by establishing a GDM mouse model. Finally, pancreatic tissues were isolated to elucidate the influence of miR-484 on inflammation processes and oxidative stress. Elevated levels of miR-484 have been observed in GDM patients, demonstrating a positive correlation with blood glucose levels. ROC curve\u00a0analysis indicated that miR-484 possesses substantial diagnostic and predictive capabilities for GDM, with an AUC of 0.835, a\u00a0sensitivity of 80.95%, and a\u00a0specificity of 82.00%. Furthermore, in GDM models, the downregulation of miR-484 significantly mitigated the adverse effects associated with GDM, leading to notable reductions in blood glucose levels and insulin resistance. Following the down-regulation of miR-484, a notable reduction in the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MDA in the pancreas was also\u00a0observed. Concurrently, there was a significant increase in the levels of SOD and CAT. miR-484 might act as a biomarker for the early-stage recognition of GDM.

This case report describes the successful management of refractory ITP using stem cell therapy in a dog that experienced severe side effects from immunosuppressive treatment. The patient experienced recurrent relapses when prednisolone (PDS) tapering was attempted during conventional immunosuppressive therapy, necessitating prolonged use of PDS; this led to complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. In this case, the dog was treated with canine adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (cAT-MSCs) administered intravenously at four-week intervals for eight sessions. Following MSC therapy, refractory ITP was successfully treated without PDS, and the side effects associated with prolonged use of PDS and multiple immunosuppressants were resolved. Although further investigations are needed for the clinical application of cAT-derived MSCs in ITP, cAT-MSC injections could be an alternative treatment option for refractory ITP in veterinary medicine."

        "Abstract":"A\u00a0high percentage of the world's population suffers from diabetes mellitus (DM). The disease leads to considerable DM-related pathological consequences and aggravates disease processes and pain as a\u00a0comorbidity. This has a\u00a0significant impact on the quality of life of these patients. This article describes DM-induced mechanisms that may contribute to increased pain. Diabetic patients exhibit low-grade systemic inflammation, high levels of blood glucose, and increased formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These factors can activate intracellular inflammatory signaling pathways and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which can lead to the release of cytokines, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These processes lead to increased local inflammation and damage to blood vessels and nerve fibers, which are considered to be causes of many diabetic complications. The increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to peripheral and central sensitization and thus to increased acute and chronic pain in diabetic patients. About 50% of people with DM develop diabetic neuropathy, which can cause numbness, discomfort, or severe pain. In addition, diabetic patients have an increased incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, which can cause additional pain."

A 13 yr old castrated male poodle was evaluated for a pancreatic mass with signs indicative of insulinoma. Imaging showed the mass occupying most of the right pancreatic limb, with its cranial margin just adjacent to the minor duodenal papilla. Although intraoperative visualization was limited by duodenal adhesions, postoperative ultrasonography and histopathology supported anatomical preservation of the accessory pancreatic duct. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed insulinoma with incomplete surgical margins, prompting adjuvant chemotherapy with imatinib. Initial follow-up revealed maintenance of normoglycemia despite development of pancreatitis. Over time, laboratory findings and clinical signs indicated progressive exocrine insufficiency, with diabetes mellitus diagnosed at 8 mo. The patient survived beyond 16 mo postoperatively without tumor recurrence. This case demonstrates that ductal preservation is anatomically feasible when tumor location permits, although functional preservation may not always follow. It highlights the complexity of balancing oncologic control with pancreatic function. Although surgical management of canine insulinoma is well described, few reports examine the impact of ductal anatomy on surgical decisions and long-term outcomes, underscoring the need for further investigation."

This prospective randomized study included 50 patients with thrombotic ALI treated at 2 hospitals between September 1, 2021, and August 31, 2023. Patients were randomly assigned using a double-blind method into Group A (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u200925), treated with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT), and Group B (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u200925), receiving catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT). The mean age was 67.16\u2009\u00b1\u20099.56\u2009years in Group A and 56.88\u2009\u00b1\u200911.38\u2009years in Group B (<i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u2009.001), though gender distribution was comparable. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was the most prevalent risk factor (88% in Group A, 72% in Group B), followed by hypertension (68%) in Group A and smoking (56%) in Group B, with no significant differences between groups. Superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery occlusions were the most common findings (68% and 56% in Group A, 72% and 68% in Group B). Retrograde contralateral femoral access was used in 60% of Group A and 56% of Group B. The technical success rate showed a tendency to be higher but did not reach statistical significance in Group A (96%) than in Group B (80%). Perioperative complications occurred in 8% of patients in both groups, with Group A experiencing 1 vessel perforation and 1 distal embolization, while Group B had 1 intracranial hemorrhage and 1 pseudoaneurysm. The 30-day mortality rate was 0% in Group A and 8% in Group B (not statistically significant). Primary patency rates at 1\u2009month were 84.0% in Group A and 81% in Group B, decreasing to 62.5% and 55.6% at 1\u2009year, respectively. Group A had 1 below-knee amputation and no above-knee amputations, whereas Group B had 2 below-knee and 3 above-knee amputations. PMT appeared to have a tendency toward higher technical success and lower amputation rates, with a safety profile similar to CDT, though these differences were not statistically significant. Its single-session approach and potential for reduced bleeding risk might offer some advantages, while CDT generally requires prolonged infusion.Clinical ImpactThis randomized study suggests that percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) using the Rotarex\u00ae\ufe0f device may offer advantages over catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in selected patients with acute thrombotic lower limb ischemia without motor deficit. PMT achieved rapid revascularization in a single session with a tendency toward higher technical success and fewer amputations, while maintaining a safety profile comparable to CDT. By potentially reducing treatment time, bleeding risk, and the need for intensive monitoring, PMT could represent a valuable addition to current endovascular practice. Larger multicenter studies with longer follow-up are warranted to confirm these findings and guide future clinical adoption."

        "Abstract":"Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) contribute to chronic inflammation characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory mediators and constitutively activated immune cells. Chronic inflammation in T2D leads to perturbations in metabolism, resulting in altered immuno-metabolic axis and further vascular complications. Hence, reducing inflammation by targeting modifiable risk factors such as adiposity, sedentary lifestyle and psychological stress in T2D may facilitate efficient clinical management. Yoga has been shown to improve glucose metabolism, reduce psychological stress, and decrease obesity, hence we sought to review the role of Yoga on cellular mechanisms regulating the immuno-metabolic axis in T2D. Elevated levels of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and CRP contributing to insulin resistance are reduced upon practicing Surya Namaskara, Pranayama, and meditation and further improved glycemic index in T2D individuals. Specific Asanas and Pranayama significantly decreased adipokines including leptin, adiponectin, and vaspin in subjects with high BMI, triglycerides and HOMA-IR values, and concomitantly reduced inflammation. Bidirectional activation of inflammatory mediators and stress hormones including epinephrine, catecholamines and cortisol manifesting in diabetes are also reduced upon practising meditation and Yoga. Yoga practices such as Pranayama, Asanas and Mudras improve insulin sensitivity, contribute to weight management, mitigate stress levels in T2D, and maintain immuno-metabolic homeostasis."

Among these, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are commonly observed but often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Understanding the prevalence and patterns of these symptoms in diabetic individuals is crucial for optimizing clinical management. In this study, the frequency of GI symptoms in individuals with DM was assessed, and their relationship to antidiabetic drugs, the length of diabetes, and glycemia control was investigated. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on 200 diabetic patients at a tertiary care hospital. Detailed medical histories were recorded, and participants underwent laboratory investigations, including HbA1c levels. Statistical analyses were performed to determine associations between GI symptoms and various clinical parameters. Among the 200 participants, 67.5% reported at least one GI symptom. The most common symptoms were fecal incontinence (37%), nausea and vomiting (34.5%), abdominal bloating (33.5%), and constipation (32.5%). Poor glycemic control (HbA1c \u22659.0%) was significantly associated with increased prevalence of GI symptoms (P < 0.01). Biguanides (metformin) were the most frequently prescribed antidiabetic drug (93%), but no significant association was found between specific oral hypoglycemia agents and GI symptoms. GI symptoms are highly prevalent in diabetic patients, with poor glycemic control playing a major role in their occurrence. Routine screening for GI symptoms should be incorporated into diabetes management to improve quality of life and treatment adherence."

Among those affected by SOPC follow-up disruptions in 2020, patients who had attended primary care clinics in 2020 had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.87) and CVD (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) than those without any primary care clinic attendance visits. SOPC service disruption was associated with increased risk of mortality and CVD among patients with DM. Primary care clinic service could be a beneficial alternative mode of service to attenuate the excessive risk. These findings support a policy that follow-up at primary care clinics should be provided for patients with DM when SOPC service is disrupted in future public health crises."

        "Title":"MHR Was Associated with Hyperuricemia Risk in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Mediating Effect of Body Mass Index.",
        "Abstract":"The monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) reflects systemic inflammation, combining the pro-inflammatory role of monocytes with the anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of HDL-cholesterol. Prior studies have established MHR as an independent predictor of hyperuricemia (HUA) prevalence. Emerging evidence further identifies MHR as a potential biomarker for early type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) screening, likely mediated through its association with insulin resistance. Therefore, our study specifically investigates the relationship between MHR and HUA in a T2DM population. This cross-sectional study enrolled 1,261 T2DM patients. Logistic regression assessed associations between MHR and HUA. Mediation analysis evaluated body mass index (BMI) as a mediator. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis examined nonlinear relationships. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared predictive performance. Elevated MHR (adjusted OR = 2.040, 95% CI: 1.023 to 4.071, p < 0.05) was independently associated with HUA risk. BMI mediated 18.59% of the associations for MHR, respectively. RCS analysis revealed nonlinear patterns, with HUA risk increasing notably when MHR > 0.47. In ROC analysis, MHR demonstrated significant predictive ability for HUA, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.62. Higher MHR was significantly associated with HUA risk in T2DM patients, with BMI serving as a key mediator. These markers may aid in early identification of patients at risk and underscore the importance of weight and inflammation control in HUA prevention."

With high morbidity and mortality, DCM poses a significant threat to patient health. Its underlying pathogenesis remains incompletely elucidated, and the prolonged subclinical phase renders early diagnosis and precise treatment clinically challenging. Thus, identifying viable biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention has emerged as a research imperative, whereas a systematic DCM diagnostic and therapeutic strategy remains to be established. Our examination revealed that circulating soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2), Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and galectin-3 levels correlate closely with DCM progression stages. Combining Lysyl Oxidase-Like 2 (LOXL2) and Electron Transfer Flavoprotein \u03b2 Subunit (ETF\u03b2) measurements with ultrasound E\/E' ratio and NT-proBNP enhances diagnostic accuracy. Novel noninvasive markers (e.g., skin autofluorescence) show promise.

        "Abstract":"Managing type 1 diabetes (T1D) is complex and requires frequent glucose monitoring, insulin dosing, and lifestyle adjustments to attain appropriate metabolic control. These self-management tasks demand intact cognitive and executive functions, particularly attention. Attention deficits in children and adolescents with T1D have been associated with poor metabolic control and an increased risk of complications. However, research into cognitive performance within this population remains limited. We evaluated attention abilities in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy controls. The study included 209 children (77 females), comprising 115 with T1D (54 females) and 94 healthy controls (23 females). The mean age of T1D patients was 12.95 years (SD 3.11), with an average disease duration of 5.22 years (SD 3.95). Cognitive functions were assessed using the MOXO Continuous Performance Test (MOXO-CPT), which evaluates attention-related parameters including sustained attention, reaction time, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. The relationship between cognitive performance and clinical parameters, including HbA1c level, treatment methods, glycemic monitoring, and disease duration, was analyzed. Children with T1D demonstrated significantly lower sustained attention scores, slower reaction times, and worse hyperactivity levels than controls. Impulsivity did not differ significantly. Patients with HbA1c levels greater than 8% showed noticeably poorer attention performance. Gender, disease duration, treatment method, and type of glycemic monitoring were not associated with attention outcomes. Children and adolescents with T1D exhibit worse neurocognitive performance, particularly in attention, compared to healthy peers. Poor metabolic control is linked to attention deficits. Routine cognitive screening of children and adolescents with T1D may enhance disease management and highlight the need for additional support in therapeutic tasks."

        "Abstract":"Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) from patients with diabetes often exhibit reduced osteogenic potential. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of G9a, known as euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2), identify its key responsive long non-coding RNA in diabetic osteoporosis (DOP), and evaluate the effectiveness of the G9a inhibitor (UNC0638). The expression level of G9a in bone-derived MSCs (BMSCs) from osteoporosis patients with or without T2DM (T2DM-BMSCs, CON-BMSCs) was detected, and osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by osteogenic genes, ALP activity and calcification level. The key lncRNA, LINC00657, was screened based on previous transcriptome sequencing, qPCR and gene overexpression assay. The downstream miRNA and the target gene of LINC00657 were identified through transcriptome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, dual luciferase reporter assay and gene overexpression assay. Rat DOP was constructed, and micro-CT, histochemical staining, immunofluorescence and qPCR were used to investigate the mechanism of UNC0638. G9a expression was increased and LINC00657 expression was decreased in T2DM-BMSCs, compared with CON-BMSCs. UNC0638 treatment improved the osteogenic potential of T2DM-BMSCs and reversed the downregulation of LINC00657. LINC00657 overexpression reverses the inhibitory effect of EHMT2 on osteogenic differentiation. miR-204-5p and IGFBP5 were screened as downstream molecules of LINC00657. LINC00657 was able to sponge miR-204-5p and upregulated IGFBP5 expression, thereby promoting osteogenesis in T2DM-BMSCs. UNC0638 treatment alleviated osteoporosis in DOP rats, whereas LINC00657 knockdown inhibited its effect <i>in vivo<\/i>. G9a inhibits the osteogenic potential of T2DM-BMSCs by regulating the LINC00657\/miR-204-5p\/IGFBP5 pathway and UNC0638 may be a potential agent for DOP treatment."

This is a cross-sectional study of 328 type 2 diabetes patients with DFIs. General clinical characteristics and biochemical indicators were extracted from the Hospital Information System (HIS) of Jinan Central Hospital in Shandong Province, China. Logistic regression analysis was performed to select predictors, and the nomogram was established based on selected viables visually. Then, the receive operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the calibration curve and the decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance of this prediction model. 5 predictors were selected by univariate analysis from 21 variables, including duration of hospitalization, Neutrophil, DBIL, ALB and Wagner grade. The multivariate logical regression analysis illustrated that these 5 factors were independent risk factors for SGAs usage in patients with DFIs. The nomogram model developed by these 5 risk predictors exhibited good prediction ability, as shown by the area under curve (AUC) of ROC curve was 0.884 in the training set and 0.825 in the validation set. Calibration curve showed a good calibration degree of the predictive nomogram model. Moreover, DCA curve showed that the nomogram exhibited greater clinical application values when the risk threshold was between 3% and 63%. Our novel nomogram model showed that duration of hospitalization, Neutrophil, DBIL, ALB and Wagner grade were the independent risk factors of SGAs usage in patients with DFIs. This prediction model behaved a great accurate value and provide reference of SGAs usage in clinic. Further validations are still needed to evaluate and improve the performance of this model."

        "Abstract":"Currently, there is limited research on the relationship between the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and the risk of prediabetes (pre-DM). This study aims to explore the potential link between AIP and the risk of progression from normoglycemia to pre-DM. In this retrospective cohort analysis, a total of 8,295 individuals receiving routine medical examinations at Kuichong People's Hospital in Shenzhen between January 2018 and December 2023 were enrolled. The Cox proportional hazards regression model assessed the association between AIP and the risk of progression from normoglycemia to pre-DM, with restricted cubic splines functions used to assess non-linear relationships. Additionally, a competing risk Cox model was used, treating the progression from normoglycemia to diabetes (DM) as a competing event for pre-DM. Finally, the subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. After multivariable adjustment, each 0.1-unit increase in AIP was associated with an 11.5% increase in the risk of progression from normoglycemia to pre-DM [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.115; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.065-1.167]. The competing risk Cox model showed that the sub-distribution hazard ratio for the association between AIP and the risk of pre-DM was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04-1.14). Additionally, a non-linear association was observed in men, with an inflection point at 0.513. Below this threshold, each 0.1-unit increase in AIP was associated with an HR of 1.204 (95% CI: 1.098-1.321). In women, the relationship was linear. This study demonstrated that elevated AIP was positively associated with the risk of progression from normoglycemia to pre-DM, with a significant sex difference in this relationship. This provides a reference for individualized risk stratification and management strategies for different sex populations and offers new perspectives for optimizing strategies to prevent pre-DM and DM."

This study uses data from the GBD 2021 to examine the global burden of T2DM attributable to low physical activity, focusing on deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and Years of Life Lost (YLLs). Descriptive analysis was performed across gender, age, region, and country for 1990 and 2021, using age-standardized rates. Trend analysis assessed the average changes in these rates from 1990 to 2021 by calculating the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). Projections for future burden were made using the exponential smoothing (ES) model and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. In 2021, T2DM attributed to low physical activity caused 149,214 deaths and 5,523,050 DALYs, with significant increases since 1990. Both age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate (ASDR) rose, especially among females. The highest burden occurred in the 95+ and 70-74 age groups. High-SDI regions had the highest rates, with rapid increases in the high-middle SDI regions. Countries like the UAE, Montenegro, and Hungary showed the highest rates. Projections from 2022 to 2050 indicate a steady rise in deaths and DALYs, with a peak in 2050, though the rate of increase is slower according to the exponential smoothing model. The burden of T2DM attributable to low physical activity has steadily increased, with concerning future trends."

        "Abstract":"Mucormycosis is a life-threatening infection caused by certain members of the fungal order Mucorales, with increased incidence in recent years. Individuals with untreated diabetes mellitus, and patients treated with deferoxamine are particularly susceptible to this infection. Elevated free iron concentrations in serum contribute to the development of mucormycosis. Pathogenic fungi have evolved multiple mechanisms to acquire and utilize free iron or extract it from the various iron-binding molecules within the host. The utilization of hydroxamate siderophores as xenosiderophores may contribute to the development of mucormycosis. The genome of <i>Mucor lusitanicus<\/i> encodes one Sit1 siderophore transporter. In this study, the role of the <i>sit1<\/i> gene was characterized by generating knockout mutants using CRISPR-Cas9. Relative transcript level of the <i>sit1<\/i> gene significantly increased in the presence of deferoxamine- and deferasirox-iron complexes. Lack of <i>sit1<\/i> resulted in altered germination of spores and growth ability, and decreased virulence. Furthermore, absence of the gene caused elevated transcript levels of a ferric reductase (FRE), a low-affinity iron permease (FET4) and a copper dependent iron oxidase (FET3). Our result suggests that expressions of the genes involved in iron uptake affect each other. The lack of Sit1 resulted in an increased transcript level of the <i>FRE3<\/i> gene, which may be able to reduce iron from the siderophore-iron complex. The reduced and liberated iron may be then taken up by activated FET4a. This study highlights the significance of understanding the iron acquisition mechanisms of pathogenic fungi to develop effective treatments for fungal infections."

Initial evaluation revealed a firm, vague mass in the left hypochondrium. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the kidney, ureter, and bladder showed features consistent with left adrenal myelolipoma, promoting laparoscopic adrenal surgery. During surgery, it was revealed that the mass was adhered to the spleen, tail of the pancreas, and left kidney, and hence laparoscopy was converted to open surgery. In the postoperative period, the patient had a foul-smelling discharge, suggesting a pancreatic duct leak. Therefore, the patient was taken up for emergency splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, removal of the splenic fissure, and transverse colostomy. Histopathological examination revealed a cystic mass, chronic pancreatitis, and inflammation, with no signs of malignancy.

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by impaired glucose metabolism, has emerged as a significant global health challenge. Effective management of diabetes encompasses not only medical interventions but also lifestyle and dietary modifications. Artificial sweeteners (ASs), due to their low caloric content and minimal impact on blood glucose levels, offer promising potential as sugar substitutes for individuals aiming to manage glycemic control. Compounds such as aspartame, sucralose, and stevia mimic the sweetness of sugar without causing hyperglycemia, making them suitable for diabetic patients. This chapter explores the role of ASs in diabetes management, with a special focus on their mechanisms of action, including modulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. An extensive review of preclinical and clinical studies evaluates the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of ASs in glycemic control, highlighting their ability to reduce caloric intake, promote satiety, and support glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in individuals with diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that ASs may influence gut microbiota, potentially affecting metabolic outcomes and insulin sensitivity, thus presenting opportunities for personalized interventions. Despite their benefits, awareness of potential risks, such as altered taste perception and over-reliance on ASs, is crucial. Integrating ASs within a broader lifestyle approach, comprising regular exercise and balanced nutrition, ensures optimal outcomes in diabetes management. This chapter emphasizes the importance of precision medicine in tailoring AS use to individual metabolic responses, underscoring its role as an adjunct to comprehensive diabetes care strategies."

        "Abstract":"Numerous therapeutic and culinary species produce scopoletin, a coumarin that is essential for treating a wide range of illnesses as a curative and chemopreventive agent. Globally, chronic illnesses are regarded as a major public health concern. Atypical regulation of various signalling pathways is the primary cause of most of these illnesses, which include cancer, as well as cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide aggregates are deposited in the CNS, forming plaques. The investigation assessed the capacity of scopoletin to modify the disease to several AD-related factors. It activated the release of insulin in the \u03b2 cell of the pancreas. Additionally, it has been noted that most currently approved treatments for these illnesses are mono-targeted and related to the development of chemoresistance, which limits their utility and prevents them from demonstrating prolonged efficacy. Conversely, the molecules originating from plants exhibit a multi-targeted nature, which has led to widespread interest in these phytochemicals due to their few adverse effects. The purpose of this review is to summarise the possible consequences of scopoletin. An outline of scopoletin pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity is given in this review. In addition, this chemical is non-toxic and has good pharmacokinetic properties, so more research in clinical settings is necessary to develop it as a possible medication. The findings from the investigation could aid in the prevention and management of illnesses as well as the understanding of the benefits of plants containing scopoletin."

        "Abstract":"Metabolic syndrome, a cluster of interconnected metabolic risk factors such as central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, significantly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite its rising prevalence and serious health consequences, metabolic syndrome remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, initially developed for T2DM management, have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential for addressing multiple components of metabolic syndrome. These drugs lower blood glucose levels by promoting glycosuria and exhibit additional benefits, including weight loss, reduced blood pressure, improved lipid profiles, and cardioprotective effects. The impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the five metabolic syndrome criteria listed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III)-central obesity, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose levels-is evaluated in this narrative review, which combines results from metaanalyses and clinical trials. Reduced waist circumference, better lipid profiles, lower blood pressure, and improved glycaemic management are some of the main outcomes. Diuresis, natriuresis, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation are the processes that underlie these effects. Although SGLT-2 inhibitors have a good safety record, they can cause uncommon diabetic ketoacidosis and urinary tract infections, which can be avoided with careful management. The study highlights that more research is necessary to understand long-term effects, optimize dosing regimens, and assess real-world applicability. According to these findings, SGLT-2 inhibitors are essential therapies for managing metabolic syndrome holistically, and they hold great promise for lowering the disease's worldwide burden and related health hazards."

The mRNA expression levels of m<sup>5<\/sup>C-related RNA methyltransferases were quantified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cellular viability and proliferation were assessed through Cell Counting Kit-8 and EdU assays. The apoptosis rate was determined by flow cytometry. Western blot was employed to analyze autophagy-related protein expression. The m<sup>5<\/sup>C modification sites on PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) were identified via dual-luciferase reporter assays. An RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine NSUN2-PINK1 interactions. Finally, a mouse model was established to further explore the role of NSUN2 in GDM in vivo. Our findings revealed elevated NSUN2 expression in HTR-8\/SVneo cells. NSUN2-mediated m<sup>5<\/sup>C modification suppressed proliferation while enhancing apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy in high glucose (HG)-stimulated HTR-8\/SVneo cells. Mechanistically, NSUN2 upregulated PINK1 expression through an m<sup>5<\/sup>C-dependent regulation. Pharmacological inhibition of PINK1 reversed these effects, enhancing proliferation while attenuating apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy under HG conditions. Conversely, PINK1 overexpression exacerbated the observed cellular responses. In vivo, NSUN2 inhibition alleviated inflammation and hyperglycemia in GDM pregnant mice. NSUN2-mediated m<sup>5<\/sup>C modification promoted GDM progression by upregulating PINK1 expression, leading to impaired trophoblast function. Targeting this NSUN2-m<sup>5<\/sup>C-PINK1 axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for GDM management."

        "Title":"\"Next-in-class\" GLP-1R Danuglipron- and Lotiglipron-like Agonists: A Patent Review (2020-2024).",
        "Abstract":"GLP-1 receptor peptide agonists have revolutionized type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity treatment, primarily through injection-based therapies. Small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists allow oral administration, but none are clinically established. Pfizer's danuglipron and lotiglipron, presented in 2018-2019, were \"first-in-class\" drug candidates, becoming prototypes for \"next-in-class\" drug development. This review summarizes \"next-in-class\" GLP-1 receptor agonists developed, identifying different relationships between the molecular structure and functional activity of agonists. Patents containing danuglipron- and lotiglipron-like agonists from January 2021 to July 2024 were browsed in databases, such as Espacenet and Google Patents, using specified keywords. Over 5,000 compounds from 67 patent publications were analyzed. Our analysis identified some key general SAR trends. The presence of a carboxyl group leads to highly active agonists, but replacing it with bioisosteric analogs may improve the ADME profile of the target compounds. The introduction of specific privileged fragments, as well as the replacement of 1H-benzo[d]imidazole nucleus or (S)-oxetan-2-ylmethyl substituent in the prototype structure with bioisosteric heterocycles, may be viable approaches. The replacement of 1,4-disubstituted piperidine linked with its (S)-2-methyl-substituted homologue or O, N-disubstituted piperidin-4-ol may also result in highly potent agonists. Additionally, the classic 2,4-EWG-disubstituted benzyl alcohol residue allows significant variability. Despite the limited clinical success of danuglipron and lotiglipron, as well as the inherent problems associated with the complex nature of GLP-1R signaling, the current state of research and the abundance of novel, promising chemotypes of highly potent compounds suggest that approved GLP-1R agonists may emerge in the coming years."

        "Abstract":"Ischaemic stroke is a major health burden. The aim of this observational study was to compare the incidence of ischaemic stroke between Muslims and non-Muslims living in southern Thailand. Patients with nonrecurrent computed tomography-proven ischaemic stroke admitted to Yala Regional Hospital during the Hijri years (AH) 1435-1439 were recruited for the study. Demographic, religious and risk factor data (hypertension, diabetes mellitus), smoking and atrial fibrillation) were collected. The study was divided into three periods using AH months as follows: baseline (months 1-4), pre-Ramadan (months 5-8) and Ramadan (months 9-12). Poisson regression was performed to explore the association between the time periods and rates of ischaemic stroke. Smoking was more common in Muslims than non-Muslims, with a higher incidence of 10.7 per 100,000 vs. 4.9 per 100,000 (P = 0.016). In relation to the three time periods, the incidence of ischaemic stroke was higher among Muslims than non-Muslims during Ramadan (13.5 vs. 5.4, P = 0.032), but not during the other time periods. For Muslims, the incidence rate ratio was higher during Ramadan (1.07; P = 0.049) than at baseline and pre-Ramadan (1.00 and 0.97, respectively; P = 0.576), whereas the ratios remained unchanged in the non-Muslim group. There was a higher incidence of ischaemic stroke exclusively among Muslims during the Ramadan."

        "Abstract":"To reveal the epidemiology of kidney disease (KD) in people living with HIV (PWLH) and to report the antiretroviral treatment (ART) management in case of kidney disease. This multicenter, retrospective observational study identified KD under four categories: acute kidney disease (AKD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), accelerated decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR > 60 mL\/min), and asymptomatic kidney disease indicated by markers of kidney damage. Clinical characteristics and etiological causes of KD in patients were evaluated. Among 2092 PLWH screened, 131 patients (6.26%) had at least one form of KD. All patients with KD were Caucasian; 112 (84.5%) were male, with a median age of 51 [range 21-80] years. The most common comorbidities were hyperlipidemia (43.5%), diabetes mellitus (33.6%), and hypertension (26.9%). AKD developed in 20 patients (0.95%), CKD in 35 patients (1.67%), accelerated GFR decline in 69 patients (3.29%), and asymptomatic KD in 7 patients (0.33%). Regarding the etiological causes, 39.7% of KD cases were attributed to ART-related nephrotoxicity, 21.4% to HIV-related nephropathy, 19.8% to comorbidity-associated KD, and 6.9% to non-ART drug nephrotoxicity. ART regimen modification was performed in 39 patients (29.6%) with ARTrelated nephropathy. Lamivudine-based ART required fewer treatment changes (9.5%) than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (38.1%) or tenofovir alafenamide (36.4%) (P = 0.04). ART-related nephrotoxicity and comorbidity-associated kidney diseases are emerging challenges in the epidemiology of KD among PLWH. Lamivudine-based ART regimens appear to be favorable in cases of KD development, showing a greater likelihood of preserving the initial treatment regimen."

This study aimed to elucidate JTD's causal targets and therapeutic mechanisms by integrating network pharmacology, Summary-data Mendelian Randomization (SMR), and molecular docking, complemented by <i>in vitro<\/i> validation. JTD's targets were cross-matched with genes associated with T2DM or NAFLD. SMR and co-localization analyses, utilizing eQTL and pQTL data, identified causal signals for each disease and their shared counterparts. GO\/KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on these shared signals. Molecular docking assessed binding interactions. In vitro experiments, including ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and lipid staining, evaluated JTD's hypoglycemic\/hypolipidemic effects, while PCR\/immunofluorescence validated key molecular predictions in High-Glucose and High-Lipid (HGHL)-induced HepG2 cells. Initial network pharmacology identified 1107 JTD targets for T2DM and 1126 for NAFLD. SMR analyses revealed 78 eQTLs and 67 pQTLs for T2DM, and 40 eQTLs and 38 pQTLs for NAFLD. Eight shared causal genetic signals were identified: <i>ADAMTS4, ALDH2, GLO1, CDH1, PDHB, PRKAB1, TCF4,<\/i> and <i>EP300<\/i>. <i>In vitro<\/i>, JTD significantly attenuated hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid deposition, downregulated IL-1\u03b2, and notably restored PRKAB1 expression in HepG2 cells treated with HGHL. Enrichment analysis revealed shared processes, including membrane microdomains, oxidoreductase activity, and responses to nutrient and oxygen levels. PRKAB1 exhibited a strong binding affinity with the JTD component Salsalate. This study identified eight genes that are genetically predicted to be causal for the therapeutic effects of JTD on both T2DM and NAFLD, thereby establishing a genetic link between the conditions. These targets and associated pathways illuminate common underlying mechanisms, supporting JTD's potential for integrated treatment strategies and providing a basis for further investigation."

        "Abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) primarily affects the lungs, but extrapulmonary manifestations, such as musculoskeletal TB, account for 15-20% of cases. Isolated intramuscular TB abscesses are exceedingly rare cases of extrapulmonary TB. Predisposing factors, such as diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and advanced age, increase the risk of such atypical presentations. This report presents a rare case of a primary tuberculous intramuscular abscess in an elderly diabetic male, emphasizing diagnostic challenges and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach. A 63-year-old male with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes presented with a 2-month history of right thigh pain and progressive swelling. Examination revealed an 8\u00d79 cm, nontender, firm lump in the right thigh with normal overlying skin. Imaging with 3T MRI showed a multilobulated fluid collection in the thigh's upper third region, predominantly in the adductor and anterior compartments, with surrounding muscle edema and multiple enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Histo-pathological examination of drained material revealed caseating granulomas with Langhans giant cells, consistent with tuberculosis. CBNAAT confirmed rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was diagnosed with a primary tuberculous abscess and initiated on a 6-month antituberculosis therapy. He showed significant clinical improvement at the 1-month follow-up and successfully completed his 6-month ATT without any intolerance. This case underscores the importance of considering TB in atypical presentations, particularly in endemic regions and high-risk populations. Prompt diagnosis through advanced imaging, histopathology, molecular testing, and appropriate surgical and pharmacological interventions is crit-ical for optimal outcomes in such rare presentations."

Four groups of individuals with dental implants were identified using multiple Swedish nationwide registers-two groups with diabetes (type 1, T1D; type 2, T2D) and two groups without diabetes (non-T1D, non-T2D). Longitudinal data from 2010 to 2020 were analysed. Peri-implantitis was defined as any registered treatment of peri-implantitis. Prevalence of peri-implantitis (n\u2009=\u200918,975) was evaluated using covariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses. Incidence (n\u2009=\u20092030) was compared using survival analyses across groups matched by age, gender, education, income and the number of implants, through propensity scores. Peri-implantitis was more frequent among those with T1D compared to non-T1D (21.1% vs. 15.2%; OR 1.46, 95% CI: 1.05-2.04), whereas the prevalence was similar in T2D and non-T2D (20.5% vs. 18.2%; OR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.98-1.16). The hazard ratios for incident peri-implantitis were 1.52 (95% CI: 0.96-2.42) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.02-1.82) for T1D and T2D, respectively. T1D and T2D were associated with a higher risk for peri-implantitis. While the elevated risk for peri-implantitis in T1D was particularly apparent in prevalence estimates, the association for T2D was evident mainly in terms of incidence."

Whole exome sequencing revealed that the patient carried a heterozygous variant in the neurogenic differentiation factor 1(NEUROD1)gene (c.1043C>A: p.A348D). Diagnosed as MODY6. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was performed on four other direct family members, identifying the same variant in the patient's mother, diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 62, and the patient's son. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the NEUROD1 p.A348D variant is likely pathogenic, and the encoded amino acid is located in the \u03b1-helix of the transcription activation domain of the NEUROD1 protein. This study identified the potential pathogenic role of the NEUROD1 p.A348D variant for the first time.

CASE REPORT We present the case of a 41-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type I diabetes mellitus and alcohol use disorder, who presented with nausea and vomiting following alcohol consumption. Initial evaluations revealed significant electrolyte imbalances and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Echocardiography indicated severe apical hypertrophy consistent with ApHCM. The patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which progressed to ventricular fibrillation (VF), necessitating cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and intensive care. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was successfully implanted for secondary prevention. CONCLUSIONS This report focuses on the clinical presentation and management of ApHCM, emphasizing the challenges of arrhythmogenic risks and the potential for refractory ventricular arrhythmias.

Addressing the pressing need for scalable, objective, and interpretable diagnostic tools, this work introduces RetinoDeep-deep learning frameworks integrating hybrid architectures and explainable AI to enhance the automated detection and classification of DR across seven severity levels. Specifically, we propose four novel models: an EfficientNetB0 combined with an SPCL transformer for robust global feature extraction; a ResNet50 ensembled with Bi-LSTM to synergize spatial and sequential learning; a Bi-LSTM optimized through genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning; and a Bi-LSTM with SHAP explainability to enhance model transparency and clinical trustworthiness. The models were trained and evaluated on a curated dataset of 757 retinal fundus images, augmented to improve generalization, and benchmarked against state-of-the-art baselines (including EfficientNetB0, Hybrid Bi-LSTM with EfficientNetB0, Hybrid Bi-GRU with EfficientNetB0, ResNet with filter enhancements, Bi-LSTM optimized using Random Search Algorithm (RSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)), using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and precision. Notably, the Bi-LSTM with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperformed other configurations, achieving superior stability and generalization, while SHAP visualizations confirmed alignment between learned features and key retinal biomarkers, reinforcing the system's interpretability. By combining cutting-edge neural architectures, advanced optimization, and explainable AI, this work sets a new standard for DR screening systems, promising not only improved diagnostic performance but also potential integration into real-world clinical workflows."

While findings were mixed, several prospective studies suggested that high daily FA intake (\u2265800 \u03bcg) or prolonged use (>3-6 months) may be associated with increased odds of GDM, especially when initiated preconceptionally. Conversely, standard-dose supplementation (\u2248400 \u03bcg) appeared neutral or potentially protective in some populations. Notably, high folate status combined with low vitamin B12 was linked to increased GDM risk, suggesting metabolic interaction. Overall, most studies were of moderate to high methodological quality. Although current evidence is inconclusive, these results support cautious use of high-dose FA supplementation and the importance of individualized prenatal nutrition, particularly considering B12 status. Further research is needed to clarify biological mechanisms."

        "Abstract":"Sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are chronic conditions that gradually affect the elderly, often coexisting and interacting in complex ways. Sarcopenia, which is characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass and function, is frequently observed in individuals with T2DM. Although the clinical association is well known, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Gene expression datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. DEGs were identified using the limma package in R (R 4.4.0). Shared DEGs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the STRING database and were visualized with Cytoscape. Hub genes were identified via six topological algorithms in the CytoHubba plugin. Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted between hub genes and selected metabolic regulators. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, and immune-inflammatory responses were significantly enriched. A PPI network revealed a mitochondrial hub of five key genes involved in energy metabolism, whose downregulation suggests mitochondrial dysfunction as a shared mechanism in sarcopenia and T2DM. Our results provide new insight into the molecular overlap between T2DM and sarcopenia, highlighting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for addressing both metabolic disruption and muscle decline."

        "Abstract":"There is a growing number of evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. At near-contact sites between mitochondria and the ER, membranes of these organelles are juxtaposed within distance of 50\u2009nm, referred to as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). The aim of this study was to carry out an ultrastructural analysis of mitochondria-associated membranes in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with newly discovered type 2 diabetes mellitus and compare them with the same structures in lymphocytes of healthy persons. Transmission electron microscopy was employed to study peripheral blood lymphocytes from newly diagnosed patients not undergoing any metabolic therapy or antidiabetic medications, as well as from healthy persons. Lymphocytes of diabetic patients had more mitochondria, albeit with unchanged mitochondrial fractional volume, and more MAMs compared to lymphocytes from healthy individuals. An increase in the number of mitochondria and MAMs in peripheral blood lymphocytes could reflect disturbed mitochondrial dynamics and immunological changes that are present in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, the results obtained in our study emphasize the possible role of mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membranes in the metabolic changes of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

        "Abstract":"Since\u00a02020, US drug manufacturers have restricted the use of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, leading to unexpected increases in medication costs for individuals with type 2 diabetes engaged in care in community health centers. To explore\u00a0experiences of individuals with diabetes regarding medication access in the era of 340B Drug Pricing Program restrictions. Qualitative study using\u00a0direct content analysis grounded in Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. Uninsured and underinsured adults who speak English or Spanish and are receiving care for type 2 diabetes in a health center setting. Semi-structured interviews, transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method by a bilingual and multiprofessional coding team. We achieved thematic saturation after 25 interviews conducted July-August 2024. Individuals described multilayered barriers to medication access during a time of 340B Drug Pricing Program restrictions. Three themes emerged: (1) participants perceived they navigate medication access alone, (2) loved ones (family, peers) shaped participants' approach to medications and lifestyle changes for diabetes treatment, and (3) language and culture of pharmacy staff are enablers of medication access. Findings build on the Andersen model by demonstrating how pharmacy policies and practice impact all four of the model's domains. In the era of 340B Drug Pricing Program restrictions, individuals with diabetes perceive that navigation resources are needed to facilitate access to medications. Pharmacy programs that target family and community units may better resonate with individuals with diabetes than those that target individual patients. Cultural and structural competence among pharmacy staff are important drivers of individuals' choice of pharmacy."

        "Abstract":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are clinically used to control hyperglycemia and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Despite their efficacy, GLP-1 RAs frequently induce nausea and vomiting as adverse effects, which are prominent factors for non-adherence to GLP-1 RAs. Therefore, new prophylaxes and treatments for GLP-1 RA-induced nausea are urgently needed. Here, we explored the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database to determine the effective drug combinations mitigating GLP-1 RA-induced nausea and vomiting in real-world settings. We further investigated the effects of the identified drugs on GLP-1 RA-induced pica behavior, a behavioral index of nausea in mice. Analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System revealed that therapeutics, including gabapentin and acetaminophen, significantly lowered the occurrence of nausea-related events in GLP-1 RA-treated patients. In mice, we confirmed that exenatide, a GLP-1 RA, significantly increased the pica behavior in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the food intake. Finally, we found that co-treatment with gabapentin significantly decreased the pica behavior induced by exenatide. These results demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of gabapentin against nausea and vomiting in patients administered GLP-1 RAs."

An infrequent form of presentation is focal multinodular, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of solid liver lesions, which may simulate solid metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging is essential to identify the fat content and avoid unnecessary scans and invasive procedures such as biopsies. Focal multinodular hepatic steatosis is associated with vascular and metabolic risk factors, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Treatment is based on modifying and controlling these underlying metabolic risk factors, with weight loss, a balanced diet, and regular physical activity being key strategies for lesion regression."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting nearly one-third of CKD patients. As CKD advances, it may progress to end-stage renal disease, necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Hyperglycemia-driven metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances contribute to oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Since current treatments remain insufficient, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to halt DN progression. Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenols (SMTPs), the focus of our research, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and have shown therapeutic potential in various disease models. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of SMTP-27 in a DN mouse model. DN was induced by removing the right kidney of db\/db mice. The efficacy of SMTP-27 was determined by evaluating the renal function using urine and serum samples and morphological assessment of the kidney tissues. For deciphering the mechanism of action of SMTP-27, markers associated with inflammatory signaling pathways in the kidney were detected. SMTP-27 (0.03, 0.3, 3, 30\u00a0mg\/kg) dose-dependently improved the renal function. In addition, it improved the mesangial matrix overproduction, podocyte injury, and renal tubule injury and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in the kidneys of mice with DN. These results indicate the potential of SMTP-27 as a novel therapeutic strategy for DN."

All patients with hypertension from six centers over the past five years were enrolled in this retrospective multi-center study. Participants from the leading institution were classified into the training set and those from the participating institutions were classified into the validation set. Baseline demographic and glycolipid metabolic characteristics were collected to establish an early diagnostic model for acute type A aortic dissection. Internal training and external validation were performed to assess the efficacy of the model. Younger age, higher body mass index, male sex, absence of diabetes mellitus, lower serum total cholesterol concentration, and higher serum lipoprotein(a) concentration were identified as risk factors for acute type A aortic dissection in individuals with hypertension. Incorporating these variables into the clinical early diagnostic model yielded receiver operating characteristic values of 0.789 (0.758-0.820) for the training set and 0.744 (0.689-0.789) for the validation set. The positive predictive value was 0.893 (0.871-0.916) for the training set and 0.835 (0.788-0.883) for the validation set, while the negative predictive values were 0.448 (0.401-0.496) and 0.448 (0.366-0.529) for the two sets respectively. Decision curve analysis for the training set showed that the model provided greater net benefit than the two extreme strategies for threshold values between 0.05 and 0.72. The same was true for the validation set when the threshold value was between 0.09 and 0.71. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test confirmed that the P values for the calibration curves of the training and validation sets were higher than 0.05, indicating good calibration. The model based on demographic characteristics and serum lipid levels was validated to have a good predictive value for acute type A aortic dissection among hypertensive individuals."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications represent major global health challenges, significantly affecting multiple vital organs. Ferroptosis-a distinct form of regulated cell death, separate from apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy-has garnered increasing attention in the pathogenesis of T2DM and its complications. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis is closely linked to \u03b2-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance-key features of the disease-making it a promising therapeutic target. This review summarizes current evidence on how natural products inhibit ferroptosis and alleviate T2DM and its complications. These compounds exert protective effects primarily by enhancing the antioxidant defense system, often through activation of NRF2, which upregulates downstream targets such as HMOX1 and GPX4. This regulatory axis counters iron overload, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage-hallmarks of ferroptosis. Natural products have demonstrated efficacy across various diabetic complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, encephalopathy, impaired wound healing, reproductive dysfunction, and other less common conditions. Their actions involve modulation of several key signaling pathways, such as AdipoR1\/AMPK, TXNIP\/NLRP3, SIRT1\/HMGB1, HIF-1\u03b1\/HMOX1, PPAR\u03b3\/TXNIP, PRDX2\/MFN2\/ACSL4, and SIRT3. By regulating these pathways, they suppress ferroptosis, mitigate tissue damage, modulate iron metabolism-related proteins, reduce oxidative stress, preserve mitochondrial integrity, and promote cell survival. These outcomes suggest promising therapeutic avenues for managing T2DM and its complications. However, despite encouraging preclinical findings, clinical validation remains lacking. Further research is needed to clarify underlying mechanisms, optimize therapeutic applications, and evaluate safety in human trials."

        "Abstract":"Cost conservation and value are major components of orthopedic surgery and health economics. One measure frequently used by surgeons to mitigate cost is the utilization of same day discharge (SDD) after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). With SDD we must also identify patient factors that support its safety and suitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate if patient travel distance is associated with safe SDD. Secondarily, we aimed to identify other patient factors associated with safe SDD. This retrospective review included all patients undergoing primary anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty by a single surgeon at a single institution between January 2021 to June 2024 in a hospital setting. Patient demographic information, medical comorbidities, surgical factors, and distance in miles to the hospital were collected. Patients were placed into two groups: those discharged the same day as surgery, and those requiring \u2265 1 night hospital stay. Outcomes collected included implant complications, 90-day emergency department utilization, and 90-day readmissions. 691 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 358 were SDD while 333 stayed \u2265 1 night. There was no association between distance traveled and SDD. Patients who were admitted were older (73.12 v 69.14; p < 0.001), more frequently women (63.1% v 44.7%; p < 0.001), less likely to be independent ambulators (70.3 % v 82.4%; p < 0.001), and more likely to live alone (24.6% v 11.7%; p < 0.001). Patients admitted for \u2265 1 night stay were also more likely to have a higher ASA score, have history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. Of all significant factors, age, female gender, level of assistance at home and ASA III remained significantly associated with hospital admission on multivariate testing. There was no difference between the two groups regarding implant complications, 90-day ED utilization or 90-day readmissions. The decision for SDD after total shoulder arthroplasty is multifactorial, but is not associated with the distance travelled by the patient to the hospital. Increased age, female gender, use of cane for ambulation and ASA III are independently associated with need for hospital admission after total shoulder arthroplasty. Living with a spouse is independently associated with same day discharge. Level III; Retrospective Cohort Comparison; Prognosis Study."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes is a major factor affecting rotator cuff tear (RCT) progression and healing. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking diabetes to RCT remain unclear. We aimed to investigate these mechanisms for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to improve tendon healing in diabetes patients. Microarray analysis was used to profile differentially expressed mRNAs in RCT samples between three diabetes and three nondiabetes patients. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) database, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and interaction networks for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING), Cytoscape, and packages of the R computing language. All the hub genes were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In total, 660 DEGs were identified, including 337 upregulated genes and 323 downregulated genes. GO annotation analysis revealed that these DEGs were mainly associated with negative regulation of growth and cellular response to zinc ion in the biological process, heparin binding and cysteine-type endopeptidase activity in the molecular function, and extracellular space and plasma membrane in the cellular component. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly involved in the Staphylococcus aureus infection, mineral absorption, phagosome, asthma and influenza A. The interaction network analysis indicated that ten hub genes, including MT1H, MT1G, MT1X, MT1M, LOX, P4HA1, EGLN3, FMOD, SLC2A1, and COMP, which are functionally involved in oxidative stress response and extracellular matrix organization. The qPCR data verified that MT1H, MT1G, MT1X, MT1M, LOX, EGLN3, FMOD, and COMP were consistent with the microarray results. This study preliminarily identified different gene expression patterns between diabetes and nondiabetes patients with RCT. Bioinformatic analyses suggested several altered molecular processes, including oxidative stress response and extracellular matrix organization, may contribute to tendon degeneration and impaired healing in diabetes patients. However, further studies are required to provide direct biological evidence for these associations."

        "Abstract":"The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide and represents a major risk factor for the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN), a severe microvascular complication. Chronic hyperglycemia activates inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways, which contribute to kidney damage. Integrins, as transmembrane adhesion receptors, play pivotal roles in regulating inflammation, immune cell trafficking, and insulin resistance. This research focused on identifying non-invasive biomarkers for T2DM and DN using PBMCs. Differentially expressed genes related to diabetes were identified through the analysis of multiple datasets retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus, including GSE95849, GSE9006, GSE25724, and GSE159984. ITGB3 was identified as a common gene across these datasets, and its expression in DN was further examined using the GSE142025 dataset. Real-time PCR analysis of PBMC samples revealed a significant upregulation of ITGB3 expression in individuals with DN and T2DM compared to healthy controls. The TF2DNA and miRNASNPv3 databases identified 10 transcription factors and 10 variants of ITGB3 involved in 60 miRNA interactions. Additionally, the DGIdb database revealed 15 drugs potentially regulating ITGB3 expression. These findings underscore the importance of integrin-related pathways in diabetes and suggest ITGB3 as a promising target for future research and therapeutic development."

This review summarizes the effects of PFASs on DM in pregnancy, adolescence, and adulthood, focusing on their roles in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, pregnancy outcomes, offspring development and glucolipid metabolism. Existing mechanisms suggest that PFASs contribute to DM by promoting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, decreasing glycogen reserves, regulating insulin sensitivity, and inhibiting insulin secretion. However, the specific pathogenic mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Current challenges include the overlooked influencing factors, interaction of combinatorial exposures, and the complexity of PFAS-associated pathogenesis. To further explore the relationships between PFAS exposure and DM, future research could involve interdisciplinary collaboration, combining graph neural networks, artificial intelligence, and network pharmacology technologies; integrating high-throughput screening with machine learning and nonlinear mixed models; using deep learning to fuse multimodal omics data; and performing in vitro and in vivo validation through organ chip and stem cell-derived models, thereby deepening the understanding of underlying mechanisms and advancing the development of early diagnosis and intervention strategies."

From November 2017 to August 2021, 5118 pregnant women who conceived by IVF\/ICSI were recruited in their first trimester. Frozen versus fresh embryo transfer. The primary outcome was perinatal complications, defined as any occurrence of perinatal death or birth defects. The secondary outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, low birth weight, and macrosomia. The safety outcomes were abortion, pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, and gestational thyroid dysfunction. A total of 2856 pregnant women were included in the analysis, with the allocation ratio of 1:1. The perinatal complication rate of the frozen embryo transfer group (5.0%, 72\/1428) was similar to that of the fresh embryo transfer group (4.6%, 66\/1428), with the RR of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.51). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the risks of preterm birth, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, low birth weight, and macrosomia between the two groups. However, compared to fresh embryo transfer, frozen embryo transfer was associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (RR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.10 to 4.62). The risk of perinatal complications was similar between fresh and frozen embryo transfer strategies, while the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension seemed to be higher for frozen embryo transfer strategy among ongoing pregnancies. Therefore, the decision on fresh or frozen embryo transfer should be more cautious, with careful consideration of the benefits and potential risks."

Kounis syndrome, an acute coronary syndrome triggered by allergic reactions, represents an association between allergies and myocardial ischemia. However, the significance of elevated cardiac biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with allergic symptoms remains unclear. This study included consecutive patients who presented to the ED with symptoms of allergic reaction. All patients underwent serial electrocardiography and hs-cTnI testing. Patients with elevated hs-cTnI levels were further evaluated by dobutamine stress echocardiography. When acute coronary syndrome was suspected in an allergic context, coronary angiography was performed. Among the 200 patients studied, 52.5% were male, 5% had diabetes mellitus, and 24% had arterial hypertension. Urticaria was the most common manifestation, occurring in 73.5% of patients. Elevated hs-cTnI levels were detected in 12% of the patients, with 6% diagnosed with Kounis syndrome and the remaining 6% had myocardial injury without ischemia. Myocardial injury was more prevalent among patients with diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking history. Among the patients with Kounis syndrome, eight had coronary disease, while only one with isolated myocardial injury had coronary artery disease. In conclusion, myocardial injury occurred in 12% of patients with allergic ED symptoms, with Kounis syndrome accounting for half of these cases. Elevated cardiac biomarkers during allergic reactions should prompt consideration of Kounis syndrome. Early recognition of this association is essential, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors."

This randomized clinical study comprised 42 DM2 patients with residual periodontal pockets, defined as probing pocket depth (PPD) \u2265 4 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP). Subjects were assigned to one of the following groups: Subgingival instrumentation (SI): SI performed in a single session; and SI\u202f+\u202fantimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT): SI in a single session, followed by pocket irrigation with BuTB and irradiation with a 660 nm diode laser at 100 mW for 50s. Periodontal clinical parameters, glycated hemoglobin levels, and immunological markers in crevicular fluid were assessed at baseline, and after 90 and 180 days. A total of 30 patients completed the study follow-up. Clinically, both groups showed improvements in periodontal parameters over time. The SI\u202f+\u202faPDT group exhibited a significantly higher percentage of closed pockets (PPD \u2264 3 mm) and a lower percentage of moderate or deep pockets (PPD \u2265 4 mm) at 90 and 180 days compared to the SI group. BOP was significantly lower in the SI\u202f+\u202faPDT group at baseline and 90 days. A reduction in PPD \u2265 4 mm and a gain in CAL were observed at both 90 and 180 days in both groups compared to baseline. In the intergroup analysis, the SI\u202f+\u202faPDT group showed a greater reduction in PPD \u2265 4 mm at 90 and 180 days, as well as a significantly improved CAL gain at 90 days compared to the SI group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between groups in immunological biomarkers (90 days period). Both treatment approaches improved periodontal parameters over time. However, the adjunctive use of BuTB-mediated aPDT with SI led to a significantly higher percentage of closed pockets (PPD \u2264 3 mm) and a lower proportion of persistent residual pockets (PPD \u2265 4 mm), indicating a more favorable clinical response in the test group. Local adjuvant therapy, such as aPDT, in the treatment of residual periodontal pockets may reduce the need for future surgical interventions and retreatment in patients with uncontrolled DM2."

While the impact of GLP-1RAs on gastrointestinal (GI) motility has been characterized, their association with mucosal damage, such as in peptic ulcer disease (PUD), has received little attention. We conducted a nationwide retrospective study of adults with T2DM using the \"All of Us\" NIH database, including a sub-group analysis of adults who were newly initiated on GLP-1RAs or insulin as second-line therapy. Our primary outcome was the odds of PUD diagnosis after time-dependent use of GLP-1 RAs, adjusting for use of insulin, NSAIDs, steroids, and PPIs and other confounders. In a sub-group analysis, we used a weighted, time-varying Cox proportional hazards model, while accounting for the competing risks of death and gastrectomy. 66,102 participants with T2DM were identified and included in our primary analysis. After adjusting for possible confounders, GLP-1 RA was associated with significantly lower odds of PUD diagnosis (adjusted Odds Ratio 0.56; 95% 0.45-0.71; p < 0.001). Our sub-group included a total of 3,313 patients (1,270 new GLP-1 RA users; 2,043 new insulin users). In this analysis, switching to a GLP-1 RA as second-line therapy was associated with a significantly lower hazard of PUD compared to switching to insulin (Adjusted Hazard Ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.30-0.63; p < 0.001). The model confirmed that active use of NSAIDs (HR 2.39) and steroids (HR 1.84) were also associated with increased likelihood of PUD. In this nationwide cohort study of T2DM patients, GLP-1 RA use was associated with 44% lower odds of PUD. In our propensity-score matched sub-group, switching to GLP-1 RA as second-line therapy was associated with a 56% lower hazard of PUD vs. insulin. These findings indicate an association between GLP-1 RA use and reduced risk of PUD."

We summarize available evidence on Zn and T2DM, including mechanistic and epidemiological\/clinical studies with a focus on Zn pathophysiology, interpretation of Zn biomarkers, and associations of Zn status and T2DM across different populations. Misdistribution of Zn in insulin-producing \u00df-cells are likely key contributors to \u00df-cell failure in T2DM, with genetic variants in ZnT8 transporters playing an important role. Epidemiological evidence has documented increased urinary Zn and decreased plasma and blood Zn in persons with established T2DM. Changes in Zn biomarkers have been prospectively associated with increased risk of T2DM in pre-diabetes and healthy adults before hyperglycemia occurs. Some studies suggest that Zn supplementation could modify glycemic endpoints in T2DM participants, but evidence is insufficient in healthy adults. Zn biomarkers, including isotopes, can provide novel approaches for T2DM risk assessment and management at different disease stages. Dysregulation of Zn metabolism occurs early in T2DM development with \u00df-cell failure playing a central role. Additional research is needed to connect mechanistic evidence and pathophysiological changes associated with various stages of T2DM progression."

The effects of ESE on blood glucose, lipid profiles, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokine levels were evaluated using ELISA, immunohistochemistry, Real-time PCR, Western blot, and transcriptome sequencing. Additionally, the regulatory effects of ESE on the TLR4\/MyD88\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were systematically analyzed. ESE treatment significantly reduced fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels in T2DM mice, while improving glucose tolerance and correcting dyslipidemia. Moreover, ESE markedly decreased serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the GSH\/GSSG ratio. At the molecular level, ESE suppressed the TLR4\/MyD88\/NF-\u03baB pathway, resulting in reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Histological analyses further revealed that ESE ameliorated the structural and functional deterioration of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. ESE improves glucose and lipid metabolism, attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation, and protects pancreatic \u03b2-cell function by modulating the TLR4\/MyD88\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in T2DM mice. These findings underscore the significant antidiabetic potential of ESE as a multi-target therapeutic agent, offering a promising new direction for T2DM treatment."

        "Title":"Colchicine alleviates atherosclerosis combined with diabetes mellitus by targeting PIM2 and regulating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",
        "Abstract":"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide due to the aging population. Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for the development of CHD, existing anti-atherosclerotic therapies do not adequately address the mechanism underlying the exacerbation of CHD in diabetic patients. Derived from the Colchicum autumnale plant, colchicine has recently gained recognition as a novel anti-inflammatory agent for CHD. However, both its efficacy and the appropriate patient population for its use remain controversial. Our study aimed to investigate the underlying effects and mechanisms of colchicine in treating atherosclerosis combined with DM via network pharmacology and experimental validation. Disease genes associated with atherosclerosis and DM were identified using the GeneCard, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases. Additionally, the targets of colchicine were obtained from the DGIDB and Swiss Target Prediction databases. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were used to analyze the primary functions of potential targets. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing and data from the GEO database were utilized to identify core targets associated with macrophages. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were conducted to investigate the interaction between the core targets and colchicine. This study employed STZ-induced APOE<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice as an animal model of atherosclerosis combined with DM to evaluate the therapeutic effects of colchicine. We further explored the underlying molecular targets and mechanisms underlying colchicine's pharmacological effects at both the tissue and cellular levels. We identified 140 potential targets associated with colchicine treatment for atherosclerosis combined with DM. GO analysis showed that these potential targets were primarily involved in the response to chemicals, regulation of signaling, cellular protein metabolic processes, and the immune system. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these core genes were primarily enriched in inflammatory pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Next, we identified four macrophage-associated core targets (PIM2, SIGLEC1, ANPEP, and MAPK10) by intersecting our transcriptome sequencing data with dataset GSE11841. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and SPR analyses revealed strong binding affinities between colchicine and these core targets, particularly PIM2. Compared with the Model group, colchicine reduced the area of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta and aortic root of STZ-induced APOE<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice by (32.70 \u00b1 6.84) % and (18.72 \u00b1 7.95) %, respectively. Furthermore, colchicine ameliorated intraplaque macrophage accumulation while enhancing plaque stability, resulting in an (84.14 \u00b1 14.03) % decrease in plaque vulnerability index. Colchicine also reduced PIM2 levels in the plaque and decreased serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. In vitro, the effects of colchicine in reducing the expression of PIM2 and inflammatory cytokines were validated in macrophages. PIM2 inhibition experiments revealed that either colchicine or HJ-PI01 alone yielded comparable reductions in inflammatory cytokines, PIM2, and the PP65\/P65 ratio. However, their combination led to a substantially stronger suppression of these markers. Colchicine shows potential as an anti-inflammatory agent for treating atherosclerosis combined with DM. Its underlying mechanisms involve targeting PIM2 to modulate macrophage function and inhibit inflammatory pathways."

        "Abstract":"Small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are emerging as promising therapeutic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Danuglipron, a novel investigational GLP-1R agonist, has demonstrated notable efficacy in clinical trials. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro metabolic stability of danuglipron and to identify its metabolites both in vitro and in vivo. Metabolite profiling was conducted using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QToF-MS\/MS). In vitro studies were performed in human liver microsomes (HLM), rat liver microsomes (RLM), and human S9 (HS9) fractions, while in vivo metabolites were identified from rat plasma, urine, and faeces. Seven novel phase I and phase II metabolites were characterized through high-resolution MS data, employing both data-dependent and data-independent acquisition, alongside in silico prediction tools. Key biotransformations included hydroxylation, O-dealkylation, oxetane ring hydrolysis followed by acetylation and methylation. The in vitro half-life (t\u2081\/\u2082) of danuglipron was 208\u202f\u00b1\u202f31\u202fmin in HLM and 81\u202f\u00b1\u202f16\u202fmin in RLM, with corresponding intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int<\/sub>) values of 7.49\u202f\u00b5L\/min\/mg and 35.57\u202f\u00b5L\/min\/mg, respectively, indicating moderate hepatic metabolism and low clearance in both species. Molecular docking suggested that certain metabolites (M-1, M-2, M-7) may have stronger GLP-1R binding affinity than the parent compound, implying potential bioactivity. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into danuglipron metabolic fate and supports further investigation of its metabolites in the treatment of T2DM and obesity."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a growing global health crisis, with India alone projected to surpass 124 million cases by 2040. Its multifactorial pathophysiology-including oxidative stress, insulin resistance, \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and impaired incretin signaling-is often inadequately addressed by existing therapies, which may lose efficacy and cause side effects over time. This highlights the need for safer, multi-targeted agents from natural sources. In this context, the present study explores the DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant potential of Cassia. angustifolia, focusing on its key constituent, sennoside A. The hydro-alcoholic extract showed notable DPP-IV inhibition (IC<sub>50<\/sub>\u00a0=\u00a0466.7\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL), with HR-LCMS confirming abundant sennoside A, which exhibited stronger inhibition (IC<sub>50<\/sub>\u00a0=\u00a0138\u00a0\u03bcM) and a mixed-type kinetic profile. Molecular docking and dynamics revealed stable interactions with key DPP-IV residues (Glu205, Glu206, Tyr547, Tyr666), supported by favourable MM-GBSA energy (-36.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.36\u00a0kcal\/mol). ADMET predictions suggested good solubility and safety. Together, these findings position sennoside A as a promising natural DPP-IV inhibitor with complementary antioxidant properties for holistic type 2 diabetes management."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, leading to hyperglycemia. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis by enhancing insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon release, and promoting satiety. However, the short half-life of endogenous GLP-1 due to rapid enzymatic degradation has led to the development of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) with improved stability and efficacy. This study investigates GLP-1cpGLP-1, a dimeric GLP-1 analog active in vivo, incorporating a flexible C-peptide linker, designed to enhance receptor activation and prolong therapeutic effects. Using molecular dynamics simulations and structural modeling, we analyzed the interaction dynamics of GLP-1cpGLP-1 with GLP-1R, comparing its binding mode to native GLP-1. Our findings reveal that GLP-1cpGLP-1 maintains essential interactions required for receptor activation while introducing novel contacts at an allosteric site, suggesting a possible positive allosteric auto-modulation mechanism. These insights highlight GLP-1cpGLP-1's potential as an innovative GLP-1RA with enhanced pharmacokinetics and receptor engagement, paving the way for future incretin-based therapeutics in T2DM and obesity."

The intricate interchanges between genetic susceptibility, metabolic changes and environmental factors contribute to the altered \u03b2-cell function, insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism leading to hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. However, the precise etiology of GDM remains incompletely understood. There is a compelling need for the identification of GDM in at-risk pregnant females at an early stage to improve maternal and fetal outcomes. Ongoing research has revealed numerous biomarkers that can be both predictive and diagnostic for GDM. This review aims to explore the various biomarkers that have increasing evidence for their use as predictors of GDM in the first and early second trimesters. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive power of these biomarkers have been compared to identify the ideal candidate(s), despite the effect of confounding factors. Throughout this review, research gaps were highlighted and future research directions were suggested to accurately diagnose GDM through a panel of efficacious biomarkers well before the disease manifests in later pregnancy."

        "Abstract":"Insulin resistance (IR), a core component in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is increasingly recognized for its role in cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. This review explores the relationship between IR, right ventricular dysfunction (RVD), and decreased lung volume in patients with T2DM. Emerging evidence suggests that IR contributes to early structural and functional alterations in the right ventricle, independent of overt cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms involved include oxidative stress, inflammation, dyslipidemia, and obesity-factors commonly found in metabolic syndrome and T2DM. These pathophysiological changes compromise right ventricular contractility, leading to reduced pulmonary perfusion and respiratory capacity. RVD has been associated with chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea, all of which are prevalent in the diabetic population. As RVD progresses, it can result in impaired gas exchange, interstitial pulmonary edema, and exercise intolerance-highlighting the importance of early recognition and management. Therapeutic strategies should aim to improve insulin sensitivity and cardiac function through lifestyle interventions, pharmacological agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1\/GIP analogs, and routine cardiac monitoring. These approaches may help slow the progression of RVD and its respiratory consequences. Considering the global burden of diabetes and obesity, and the growing incidence of related complications, further research is warranted to clarify the mechanisms linking IR, RVD, and respiratory dysfunction. Understanding this triad will be crucial for developing targeted interventions that improve outcomes and quality of life in affected patients."

While 75% of the patients in the CSII group had good control with HbA1c < 7% after one year of sensor use, only 34.6% in the MDI group achieved these values. However, the CSII group presented a higher coefficient of variation (62.31% at 3 months and 43.08% at 1 year) (<i>p<\/i> = 0.02), and a higher number of hypoglycemic episodes (7.38% and 7.32%, respectively) (<i>p<\/i> = 0.016).

However, the TIR values were still below the range considered to be indicative of good control. These findings lead us to question whether CSII should be initially considered in specific cases where HCL is not possible, or if it would be more effective to wait until the patient is ready, or the necessary resources are available to start directly CSII integrated in a closed loop system."

        "Abstract":"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of conditions, including obesity, insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia, and hypertension, that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While studied often in adults, the increasing prevalence of MetS in children and adolescents underscores the need for its early detection and intervention. Among various biomarkers, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) has gained substantial attention due to its associations with metabolic health and disease. This review provides a comprehensive overview of SHBG and its association with MetS, with a focus on the pediatric and adolescent population. The interplay between SHBG, puberty, and metabolic risk factors is explored, including racial and ethnic variations. SHBG plays a crucial role in transporting sex hormones and regulating their bioavailability and has been found to correlate inversely with obesity and IR, two key components of MetS. Puberty represents a critical period during which hormonal changes and metabolic shifts may further influence SHBG levels and metabolic health. Understanding SHBG's role in early metabolic risk detection could provide novel insights into the prevention and management of MetS."

        "Abstract":"Vitamin D has emerged as a modulatory factor in the pathogenesis and management of diabetes mellitus due to its influence on pancreatic \u03b2-cell function, immune regulation, and inflammatory pathways. This narrative review critically examines mechanistic and clinical evidence linking vitamin D status with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and gestational diabetes (GDM). In T1DM, vitamin D's immunomodulatory effects are thought to protect \u03b2-cells from autoimmune destruction; epidemiological studies associate vitamin D sufficiency with lower T1DM incidence and improved glycemic control, although causality remains under investigation. In T2DM, vitamin D deficiency is associated with worsened metabolic control and may contribute to disease development in at-risk individuals; however, it does not influence the initial onset of T2DM in patients who are already diagnosed. Intervention trials indicate that correcting the deficiency can modestly improve insulin sensitivity, \u03b2-cell function, and metabolic parameters. GDM has similarly been linked to hypovitaminosis D, with low maternal vitamin D levels associated with higher GDM risk and adverse perinatal outcomes; mechanistic insights suggest that adequate vitamin D supports glucose homeostasis in pregnancy, and emerging trials demonstrate improved insulin resistance with maternal vitamin D supplementation. Across these diabetes subtypes, maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels appears to confer metabolic benefits and may serve as an adjunct to current preventive and therapeutic strategies. However, definitive evidence from large-scale trials is required to establish optimal vitamin D supplementation protocols and confirm its efficacy in diabetes care."

However, early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC), diagnosed in individuals aged \u2264 45 years, presents unique challenges and remains poorly understood in young populations. Therefore, we conducted an observational cohort study using a prospective longitudinal design (2021-2024) involving 1823 Saudi nationals aged 18-45 years who underwent zoom high-definition chromoendoscopy to evaluate the prevalence of premalignant gastric lesions (PGLs) and EOGC. We found a high <i>H. pylori<\/i> prevalence (78.0%) with PGLs in 1.9% of participants and EOGC-adenocarcinoma in 0.7% of patients. All EOGC cases arose from dysplasia, with most PGLs being classified as OLGA\/OLGIM stage II\/III. Multiple risk factorswere significantly associated with PGLs and EOGC, including <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection (<i>p<\/i> = 0.022), increasing age (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001), a family history of gastric cancer (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001), poor dietary habits (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001), obesity (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001), and smoking (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001).

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a growing global health concern, is closely linked to obesity and sedentary behavior. Central to its development are insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in peripheral tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, which plays a key role in energy expenditure, glucose uptake, and insulin sensitivity. Notably, increased accumulation of lipid metabolites in skeletal muscle is observed both in endurance exercise-associated with improved insulin sensitivity-and in high-fat diets that induce insulin resistance. The review examines the contrasting metabolic adaptations of skeletal muscle to these opposing conditions and highlights the key signaling molecules involved. The focus then shifts to the role of the stress kinase p38\u03b1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in skeletal muscle adaptation to overnutrition and endurance exercise. p38\u03b1 enhances mitochondrial oxidative capacity and regulates nutrient utilization, both critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. During exercise, it cooperates with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to boost glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, key mechanisms for improving insulin sensitivity. The co-activation of p38\u03b1 and AMPK in skeletal muscle emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue to combat insulin resistance and T2D. The review explores strategies for selectively enhancing p38\u03b1 activity in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, it advocates a comprehensive approach to T2D prevention and treatment, combining established caloric intake-reducing therapies, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, with interventions aimed at increasing energy expenditure via activation of p38\u03b1 and AMPK signaling pathways."

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a serious disease which affects millions of people worldwide and is a major factor for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). In this study, we first characterized cognitive and memory impairments, then evaluated their underlying molecular mechanisms, and finally determined sex-dependent effects in male and female mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D. Our findings indicated that significant cognitive impairment, memory loss, and vascular dementia occurred in male and female T1D mice. Cerebral artery (CA) blood flow was greatly reduced in the various brain regions tested. ROS generation in isolated cells, mitochondria, and mitochondrial complex III from CA smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) were all increased in T1D. DNA damage and Tau phosphorylation in CASMCs were largely increased. Linear regression analysis revealed that T1D-induced increased blood glucose was highly correlated with increased ROS production and increased VCID. Taken together, we conclude that T1D causes increased mitochondrial complex III ROS production, DNA damage, and Chk2 phosphorylation in CASMC, thereby leading to vascular dementia in both male and female mice; our results further demonstrate that mitochondrial complex III ROS-mediated DNA damage is more significant in male than female mice, which contributes to more serious vascular dementia in the former than the latter."

        "Abstract":"Obesity is a complex chronic inflammatory condition that results from excess fat accumulation. It increases the risk of developing numerous co-morbidities such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and stroke. The adipose tissue is itself a vital endocrine organ that secretes numerous adipokines, cytokines, and exosomes, which are collectively known as the adipose-derived secretome (ADS). This ADS has been shown to influence and modulate many physiological processes. During obesity, the composition of ADS is altered, which may contribute to the development of obesity-associated diseases. Type-2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common complications of obesity due to alterations in glucose homeostasis. Glucose absorption occurs via Na-glucose co-transport via SGLT1 at the brush border membrane (BBM) of small intestinal villus cells. This process of transepithelial glucose uptake is the primary method of glucose absorption from diet. However, how ADS mediates the function of SGLT1 is not yet known. This study aims to determine the mechanism of regulation of SGLT1 by ADS in intestinal epithelial cells. We show that ADS from OZR (but not LZR) stimulates SGLT1 in IEC-18 cells. OZR-ADS treatment diminished Na\/K-ATPase activity in IEC-18 cells. Kinetic studies indicated that the mechanism of stimulation for SGLT1 during OZR-ADS treatment was secondary to an increase in the affinity (1\/K<sub>m<\/sub>) of the co-transporter for glucose without a change in co-transporter number. Western blot studies revealed that SGLT1 protein expression was unaltered in the two groups, confirming our kinetic studies. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that an increase in the affinity of the SGLT1 protein was mediated by altered phosphorylation. In conclusion, during obesity, the adipose tissue secretome stimulates SGLT1 in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to an increase in affinity for glucose. The affinity change is due to alterations in SGLT1 phosphorylation. Together, these results may provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying altered glucose homeostasis in obesity and how this may lead to the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus."

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease mediated by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus which affects 30-40% of T1D patients. Increasing evidence suggests the significant role of the microbiome in the progression of both T1D and DKD. Here we recruited 76 T1D patients and 22 healthy controls and combined data from sigmoid colon biopsy samples analysed with V3-V4 region amplification of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data obtained from faecal samples. Additionally, we compared T1D patients with and without progression of DKD. We observed significant differences within both sample types at various taxonomic and functional levels. T1D patient microbiota detected using biopsy samples had a lower abundance of the <i>Bacteroides<\/i> genus when compared to healthy controls. Significantly, despite only a few taxonomic differences patients with and without DKD progression were vastly different at the functional pathway level within the faecal samples - we observed 2 and 61 enriched pathways in these groups. respectively, with several of these pathways linked to the mediation of renal function. Altogether, we present novel data about microbial signatures relevant to T1D and DKD progression, which partly supports previous data and also presents possible tissue type or population-specific elements. DKD progression is characterized with significant differences within the functional level of the gut microbiome."

        "Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum biomarkers Orexin A, PBP4, FGF19, and insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR, and neonatal weight in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A total of 80 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Baseline characteristics, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gestational age, were recorded. Fasting blood samples were collected to assess serum levels of Orexin A, PBP4, and FGF19, as well as to calculate HOMA-IR as a measure of insulin resistance. Neonatal birth weight was documented at delivery. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlation, multivariate linear regression, and subgroup analysis based on median values of HOMA-IR and neonatal birth weight. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between insulin resistance, and neonatal birth weight (R\u2005=\u20050.45, P\u2005<\u2005.001). The low HOMA-IR group has significantly higher levels of Orexin A, PBP4, and FGF19 compared to the high HOMA-IR group (P-values: .02, .04, and .01, respectively), indicating a negative association with insulin resistance. Orexin A, PBP4 and FGF19 are negatively associated with both insulin resistance (P\u2005<\u2005.01, P\u2005<\u2005.01, P\u2005=\u2005.03) and birth weight (P\u2005=\u2005.02, P\u2005<\u2005.01, P\u2005=\u2005.02). Furthermore, a moderation effect of BMI on the relationship between PBP4 levels and insulin resistance, with stronger associations observed in women with a higher BMI. The study reveals that serum Orexin A, PBP4, and FGF19 are significantly associated with insulin resistance and neonatal weight in GDM, with BMI modulating the impact of PBP4 on insulin resistance. These biomarkers could serve as predictive indicators for insulin resistance and fetal growth in GDM, suggesting potential mechanism of insulin resistance affecting newborn weight."

We selected instrumental variables from genome-wide association study summary statistics, which included datasets of circulating leukocytes, flow cytometric subgroups of lymphocytes, and DN. Applying the standard Mendelian randomization approach and refining it with sensitivity analysis and horizontal pleiotropy examination, we found a significant causal association between increased eosinophil counts and a higher risk of DN (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.37, P = .00027), which remained robust after further analysis. However, no causal link was observed between lymphocyte flow cytometric subgroups and DN. These findings suggest that elevated eosinophil counts may contribute to the progression of DN, potentially advancing to end-stage renal disease. The lack of a causal relationship between lymphocyte subtypes and DN underscores the need for larger scale genome-wide association study data for further validation. This research provides important causal evidence for considering eosinophil counts as a potential biomarker in DN diagnosis and management."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) represent a significant complication affecting the lower extremities in individuals with diabetes. The development and progression of DFUs are primarily influenced by diabetic neuropathy (DN) and diabetic peripheral artery disease (DPAD). Recent studies indicate a novel link between the gut microbiota and these risk factors. However, it remains unclear whether a causal relationship exists between them. We obtained data on gut microbiota, derived from publicly available genome-wide association studies. Additionally, we included data on DN, diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), and DPAD from the FinnGen consortium, considering these conditions as primary risk factors for the onset of DFUs. We employed the inverse variance weighting method for the primary effect analysis and conducted 3 sensitivity tests to ensure the robustness of the results. Our analysis revealed that 7 genera are associated with DN, 8 are associated with DPN, and 12 are associated with DPAD. Notably, the Lachnospiraceae emerged as a common risk factor for both DN [OR\u2005=\u20051.392, 95% CI (1.031, 1.880), P\u2005=\u2005.031] and DPAD [OR\u2005=\u20051.152, 95% CI (1.019, 1.303), P\u2005=\u2005.024]. Conversely, the Acidaminococcaceae was identified as a shared protective factor against both DPN [OR\u2005=\u20050.620, 95% CI (0.460, 0.837), P\u2005=\u2005.002] and DPAD [OR\u2005=\u20050.814, 95% CI (0.691, 0.959), P\u2005=\u2005.014]. The sensitivity analysis indicated minimal evidence of bias in this study. Our research findings suggest a potential causal relationship between gut microbiota and the key risk factors for developing DFUs. This suggests that early detection and prevention of this serious diabetic complication might be achievable through gut microbiota modulation."

Cranial nerve involvement, including facial and abducens nerve palsies, is an uncommon but serious complication. We present the case of a 47-year-old female with uncontrolled diabetes and iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome who developed mucormycosis complicated by right-sided facial weakness (upper motor neuron type) and abducens nerve palsy (lower motor neuron type). She presented with a 1-month history of right-sided facial swelling, headache, and earache, and a 6-day history of sudden-onset facial weakness. Examination revealed preserved eye closure and forehead wrinkling, with a deficit in right eye abduction. Black eschar was noted in the intranasal and hard palate areas. Imaging (computed tomography paranasal sinuses and magnetic resonance imaging) and histopathological confirmation established the diagnosis. Treatment included amphotericin B and 2 surgical debridements following otorhinolaryngology consultation. Patient's facial swelling improved during hospital stay, and abduction deficit resolved on 1-month follow-up. This case highlights the critical need for early recognition and multidisciplinary management of mucormycosis, particularly in diabetic or immunocompromised patients presenting with cranial nerve deficits. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are vital to reduce morbidity and improve outcomes."

Insulin resistance (IR) is a key shared mechanism. This study aimed to investigate the association between MASLD and IR in individuals with normal glucose levels. We recruited participants from communities and outpatient clinics in central and northern Taiwan, excluding those with impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Data collected included body mass index, blood pressure, body fat percentage, and lifestyle factors. After overnight fasting, blood samples were taken. MASLD was diagnosed via abdominal ultrasonography. IR was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance formula and categorized into tertiles (T1-T3). Statistical analyses included analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression. Among 485 participants (mean age 42.0\u2005\u00b1\u200511.4 years), MASLD prevalence increased with IR levels (T1: 34.1%, T2: 40.1%, T3: 47.8%; P\u2005<\u2005.001).

        "Abstract":"Clozapine is a unique antipsychotic drug used to treat treatment-resistant psychosis. Clozapine can induce metabolic complications and weight gain, and may lead to acute diabetic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Neurological side effects of clozapine are relatively rare compared with those of typical antipsychotics; however, several cases have been reported. In particular, reports have suggested that clozapine-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) may present with atypical features. While multiple reports document DKA and NMS occurring separately in patients receiving clozapine, no cases have been reported in which they occur simultaneously. We report a case in which DKA and NMS developed concurrently, with NMS manifesting atypical features and the significant stress associated with NMS hindering recovery from DKA. A 23-year-old man presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia 3 years earlier and was taking medications prescribed at another hospital. His regimen was changed 2 months prior to presentation. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated blood ketone levels. The patient was diagnosed with DKA, and intensive insulin therapy was initiated. However, he developed fever and altered mental status during treatment, and despite intensive insulin therapy, the improvement of metabolic acidosis was hindered. Although the typical symptoms of NMS, such as rigidity and a rapid increase in creatine kinase (CK), were not observed, based on the history of clozapine treatment, persistent fever, altered mental status, and blood pressure instability, NMS was diagnosed. Insulin and intravenous fluid therapy were continued for DKA, and clozapine was discontinued. Following clozapine discontinuation, metabolic acidosis, fever, and altered mental status improved rapidly. DKA and NMS share various signs, such as fever, altered mental status, blood pressure instability, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Therefore, in patients receiving clozapine, the simultaneous occurrence of DKA and NMS should be considered. Additionally, clozapine-induced NMS may present in an atypical form; therefore, even in the absence of typical signs, such as rigidity and a rapid increase in CK, the possibility of NMS should be reconsidered."

In total, 1985,678 pregnant women were analyzed, of whom 15,086 were diagnosed with gestational diabetes in their first pregnancy. By categorizing pregnant women into the gestational diabetes recurrence and nonrecurrence groups, we attempted to confirm the risk factors for gestational diabetes recurrence. Herein, 5672 and 9414 cases of gestational diabetes recurrence and nonrecurrence were analyzed. In the first and second pregnancy, maternal age and gestational age at delivery, and neonatal birthweight, were significantly different between 2 groups (P\u2005<\u2005.001). Preterm birth under 37 weeks of gestation, gestational hypertension, and neonates of large for gestational age, were also significantly more occurred in the recurrence group, compared to the nonrecurrence group (P\u2005<\u2005.001). The interval between the first and second deliveries was significantly longer in the recurrence group (P\u2005=\u2005.0016).

Bone marrow (BM) as a previously neglected site of diabetic end-organ damage, characterized by microangiopathy, neuropathy, fat deposition, and inflammation. As a result, diabetes may lead to negative consequences for physiologic hematopoiesis, which may increase the risk of aplastic anemia (AA). Summary genetic data for diabetes mellitus (DM) were sourced from FinnGen; while the data for AA and immune cell traits were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS database. We performed a two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal effects of DM on AA. Simultaneously, multivariable MR was utilized to further estimate the direct effect of subgroup (distinct types) of diabetes on AA. Then, a two-step mediation MR analysis was conducted to examine 731 immune cell traits that may mediate these effects. Several methods were used to evaluate the robustness of the results, including sensitivity analyses with Cochran Q statistic, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO, which also help mitigate potential bias from horizontal pleiotropy. The two-sample univariate MR analysis demonstrated DM was significantly and positively linked to the incidence of AA (IVW, OR\u2005=\u20051.12; 95% CI: 1.05-1.95; P\u2005=\u20055.11e-04), which was comparable to the direct effect estimated for type 2 diabetes on AA risk in multivariable MR (multivariable IVW, OR\u2005=\u20051.18; 95% CI: 1.03-1.35; P\u2005=\u20051.96e-02). In two-step mediation MR, we explored 54 immune cell traits associated with DM, among these, only the Resting CD4\u2005+\u2005regulatory T cell absolute count emerged as a potential mediator influencing the risk of AA, accounting for 10.64% of the effect. We found robust genetic evidence for a causal association between DM and AA risk, and rest CD4+ Treg absolute count, might mediate this effect. However, the potential implications of our findings for AA prevention require validation through well-powered randomized clinical trials."

Disruption of brain insulin pathways contributes to amyloid-beta accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation. These shared features have led to the concept of \"Type 3 Diabetes\" (T3D). This review aims to investigate the molecular links between insulin resistance and AD and to highlight emerging therapeutic strategies. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies published between January 2010 and July 2025. Search terms included \"Diabetes Mellitus\", \"Insulin Resistance\", \"Alzheimer Disease\", \"Nerve Degeneration\", \"Cognitive Dysfunction\", and other related molecular and clinical keywords. After removing duplicates and applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 213 peer-reviewed articles were included in the final analysis. Insulin resistance was consistently identified as a key pathological driver, impairing brain glucose uptake, amyloid-beta clearance, and tau phosphorylation. Disruption of insulin signaling pathways, especially PI3K\/Akt and GLUT4 translocation, was associated with neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline. Additionally, transcriptomic data highlighted the role of non-coding RNAs, including MEG3 and MALAT1, in modulating insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, linking metabolic imbalance to neuronal dysfunction. Insulin resistance and disrupted glucose metabolism play a central role in the development and progression of AD, supporting the concept of T3D. Targeting these pathways shows promising neuroprotective potential. Future studies should focus on validating these interventions in large-scale clinical trials."

        "Abstract":"Imeglimin as a novel antidiabetic agent has emerged promising effects compared to previously established treatments. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis and umbrella review evaluated the efficacy and safety of Imeglimin in managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central was conducted up to June 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least 12 weeks of follow-up, involving adult T2DM patients, were included. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and any discrepancies were resolved by a third investigator. Outcomes were pooled using random-effects or fixed-effects models based on heterogeneity. The quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Also, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Twelve RCTs evaluating the effect of imeglimin on metabolic factors were included. Imeglimin significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (SMD: -0.51; 95% CI: -0.72, -0.29, <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001; <i>I<\/i><sup><i>2<\/i><\/sup>\u2009=\u200975.27%, P-heterogeneity\u2009<\u20090.001) and HbA1c (SMD: -0.45; 95% CI: -0.86, -0.05, <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.031; <i>I<\/i><sup><i>2<\/i><\/sup>\u2009=\u200994.10%, P-heterogeneity\u2009<\u20090.001). Also, it improved homeostasis model assessment of \u03b2-cell function (HOMA-\u03b2) (SMD: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.01, <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.020; <i>I<\/i><sup><i>2<\/i><\/sup>\u2009=\u200959.30%, P-heterogeneity\u2009=\u20090.06). Whereas, imeglimin failed to affect insulin, level, HOMA-IR, and c-peptide level, significantly (<i>P<\/i>\u2009>\u20090.05). However, its unfavorable effect was shown in term of LDL (SMD: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.53, <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.017; <i>I<\/i><sup><i>2<\/i><\/sup>\u2009=\u20090.0%, P-heterogeneity\u2009=\u20090.68). Imeglimin has demonstrated efficacy and a favorable safety profile in the management of T2DM, particularly regarding glycemic control and lipid profile. Further large-scale trials across diverse populations are warranted to confirm these outcomes. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186\/s13098-025-01922-2."

        "Title":"Co-treatments of vitamin D and mesenchymal stem cells effectively alleviate the diabetic kidney disease through attenuating the SIRT1-mediated pathways.",
        "Abstract":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is still as a common chronic micro-vascular complication of type 1 diabetic (T1DM). Although many studies had verified the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the clinical treatment of the related complications associated with T1DM, especially the DKD, by preserving the balances of immune micro-environment and so on. However, the immunomodulatory capabilities of MSCs are still controversial on the the efficacy of DKD treatment primarily due to the variations on the immune micro-environment, which could be modulated by a variety of elements, such as the vitamin D (VD). Otherwise, its underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Herein, the purpose of our study was to explore the synergistic effects of co-treatments with VD and MSCs in vivo and in vitro on the progression of DKD by attenuating the SIRT1-mediated pathways. Four-week-old male mice were fed with different VD diets for four weeks and established the T1DM models by administering the STZ (40\u00a0mg\/kg) via intraperitoneal injection, which were then treated with BMSCs (bone MSCs) injection through the tail vein. After the euthanasia, the renal functions, pathological productors and VD metabolites were evaluated by the related biochemical indicators, flow cytometry analysis, staining techniques and immunofluorescence in the serum and\/or renal tissues. Meanwhile, the mechanisms of SIRT1-mediated pathways underlying the amelioration of co-treatment with VD and MSCs on the renal injuries were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays, which were then verified by the MPC5 cells in vitro with SIRT1-specific knockdown and over-expression under the treatment of high glucose (HG). Totally, co-treatments of VD and MSCs could more effectively ameliorate the disorders of glucose metabolism and renal injuries (KIM1, Podocin, ZEB1 and\/or ZEB2) by boosting the concentrations of VD metabolites both in the STZ-induced T1DM mice models and MPC5 cells with HG treatment in vitro (<i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, the mechanism results indicated that co-treatments of VD and MSCs could improve the DKD such as the renal inflammation and fibrosis by attenuating the SIRT1 to inhibit the activation of TGF\u03b21\/Smad pathways both in vivo and in vitro (<i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, over-expression of SIRT1 could partly abolish the inflammation and fibrosis in vitro by attenuating the SIRT1-mediated TGF\u03b21\/Smad3 pathways, which might be aggravated under the down-regulated expressions of SIRT1 in vitro (<i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Our findings had detailed the mechanisms underlying the amelioration of VD and MSCs related SIRT1-mediated pathways agonist on the DKD-like pathology both in vivo and in vitro, which could highlight the important potential of SIRT1 as a promising therapeutic target for the progression of DKD.

        "Abstract":"Mesenchymal stem\/stromal cells (MSCs) or MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are considered potential modulators of the immune system in type 1 diabetes (T1D) therapy. On the other hand, preconditioning MSCs with inflammatory agents is a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic effects of these cells. Therefore, we performed various direct preconditioning regimens (IFN-\u03b3, poly(I: C), LPS, and hypoxia) on clonal MSCs (cMSCs), and for indirect preconditioning regimens, the same regimens were applied to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMC-derived concentrated conditioned media (CCM) was transferred into cMSC cultures to mimic in vivo conditions to obtain cMSC-EVs with better immunomodulatory effects and then selected hypoxia-induced cMSC-EVs and their source cells to determine their influence on immune responses in multiple low-dose\/Streptozotocin (MLD\/STZ)-induced mouse model. Direct preconditioning regimens include four groups: IFN-\u03b3 (50 ng\/ml), poly(I: C) (42.22\u00a0\u00b5g\/ml), LPS (1\u00a0\u00b5g\/ml), and hypoxia (1% oxygen). For indirect preconditioning, these regimens were applied to PBMCs, and PBMC-derived CCM was added to cMSC cultures. The resulting cMSC-CCM was assessed for the expression of anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, and regenerative factors and its ability to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. The isolated EVs from the most effective direct and indirect preconditioned cMSC-CCM groups and their source cells were transplanted in MLD\/STZ-induced mouse models of T1D and followed for 73 days. In vitro characterization revealed that direct and indirect hypoxia preconditioning were the most effective groups among the different preconditioning regimens. Therefore, four treatment groups, including direct hypoxia-induced cMSC-EVs (dH-MSC-EVs), indirect hypoxia-induced MSC-derived EVs (iH-MSC-EVs), and their cell sources (dH-MSCs and iH-MSCs), were selected for EV isolation and animal studies. The in vivo study revealed that the fasting blood glucose (FBG) trend decreased in the four treatment groups compared with the sham group. However, the effects of direct\/indirect hypoxia on cMSC-EVs were associated with an increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the serum of the MLD\/STZ-induced mouse models compared with their parental cell counterparts. Indeed, iH-MSC-EVs attenuate immune responses in MLD\/STZ-induced mouse models. Furthermore, compared with their source cells and dH-MSC-EVs, iH-MSC-EVs significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) in the serum of the MLD\/STZ-induced mouse models. Our results showed the effectiveness of direct\/indirect hypoxia preconditioning for cMSCs to modulate immune responses in the MLD\/STZ-induced mice model. This study demonstrated that the immunomodulatory potential of iH-MSC-EVs is significantly greater than that of dH-MSC-EVs and their source cells. Our results suggest iH-MSC-EVs, could be a potential option for modulating the immune response in T1D."

        "Abstract":"The management of type 2 diabetes not only requires effective medications to regulate blood glucose levels, but also needs to consider the economic implications. Liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide, three widely-used glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, have shown significant efficacy in diabetes treatment. This review aimed to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide in comparison to dulaglutide or oral semaglutide for treating type 2 diabetes. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane. Studies published up to December 31, 2024 were retrieved. Two independent reviewers carefully screened the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and any disagreements were resolved with the involvement of a third reviewer. Data extraction was carried out following a pre-designed form. 12 studies were included, evaluating liraglutide vs. dulaglutide (n\u2009=\u20098) and liraglutide vs. oral semaglutide (n\u2009=\u20096). The minimum consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards score for the studies was 0.75. The included studies exhibited similar results in cost-effective. Oral semaglutide would be more effective and cost-saving in the US, Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. According to the available studies, liraglutide vs. dulaglutide or oral semaglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is considered not to be cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness also plays a vital role in the inclusion of these drugs in healthcare reimbursement policies. The literature suggested that dulaglutide or oral semaglutide may be more cost-effective than liraglutide."

        "Abstract":"Women with obesity-driven type 2 diabetes (T2D) face worse breast cancer outcomes, yet metabolic status does not fully inform current standards of care. We previously identified plasma exosomes as key drivers of tumor progression; however, their effect on immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear. Using a novel patient-derived organoid (PDO) system that preserves native tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), we show that T2D plasma exosomes induce a 13.6-fold expansion of immunosuppressive TILs relative to nondiabetic controls. This immune dysfunction may promote micrometastatic survival and resistance to checkpoint blockade, a known issue in T2D cancer patients. Tumor-intrinsic analysis revealed a 1.5-fold increase in intratumoral heterogeneity and 2.3-fold upregulation of aggressive signaling networks. These findings reveal how T2D-associated metabolic dysregulation alters tumor-immune crosstalk through previously underappreciated exosomal signaling, impairing antitumor immunity and accelerating progression. Understanding these dynamics could inform tailored therapies for this high-risk, underserved patient population."

        "Abstract":"Prediabetes is a non-communicable disease (NCD) that is common in New Zealand (NZ), and it can lead to poor health. The aim of this study was to identify whether there is an increased risk of developing prediabetes among 11-13-year-olds, outside an organised screening programme. Consenting school aged children and their parents completed a series of screening questionnaires including dietary patterns, anthropometrics and socio-economic characteristics. Adapted Australasian Paediatric Endocrinology Guidelines (APEG) criterion was used to identify children at risk of developing prediabetes or have new onset prediabetes. Of the 276 participants, significant differences between Pacific, M\u0101ori and non- M\u0101ori non-Pacific children were evident among those who: were obese (BMI\u2009>\u200995th percentile); lived in overcrowded homes and in deprived areas. In our study, a large proportion of children (35%) were at risk of developing prediabetes. From our dietary analyses, we identified two distinct dietary patterns from among the children: (1) a diverse diet that included a wide range of foods, but was particularly high in sweet and savoury snacks, takeaway foods, and sugary drinks; and (2) a predominantly vegetarian diet rich in legumes. The study prevalence of prediabetes risk is indicative of childhood lifestyles, and we recommend early screening and better resourcing for promotion of healthy nutrition as preventative measures."

        "Abstract":"This study aimed to identify therapeutic targets and signaling pathways of Capilliposide A (LC-A) for diabetic nephropathy (DN) through integrated network pharmacology and experimental validation. Using a DN mouse model induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ), we investigated the molecular mechanisms of LC-A. The PubChem database provided the two-dimensional structure of LC-A, with subsequent identification of LC-A\/DN-associated targets through intersection analysis. Core targets were determined via protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, followed by gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses. Molecular docking simulations evaluated LC-A's binding affinity to DN-related targets. C57BL\/6 mice receiving HFD and STZ intraperitoneal injections were treated daily with LC-A or metformin (MET) via oral gavage for 8\u00a0weeks. Weekly monitoring included body weight and blood glucose measurements. Post-treatment assessments encompassed serum lipid profiles, renal function biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, and renal histopathology. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed to analyze inflammatory pathway proteins and apoptosis-related factors. Network pharmacology identified TLR4, NF-\u03baB1, STAT3, EGFR, mTOR, and MAPK as core targets involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis regulation. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed critical inflammatory pathways including IL-17, TNF, and Th17 cell differentiation. Molecular docking confirmed stable binding of LC-A to TLR4, NF-\u03baB1, Bax, and Bcl-2. In vivo experiments demonstrated that LC-A significantly reduced renal injury markers (KI, SCR, BUN), lipid profiles (TG, TC), and oxidative stress (MDA), while enhancing antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPX, CAT) in DN mice (P\u2009<\u20090.05). LC-A effectively suppressed serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, iNOS) through NF-\u03baB pathway modulation and apoptosis regulation (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Histopathological analysis revealed attenuated renal cortical vacuolization, tubular swelling, glomerular mesangial expansion, sclerosis, and inflammatory infiltration. These findings suggest LC-A as a promising natural nephroprotective agent for DN prevention and treatment."

        "Abstract":"Neurological disorders are increasingly prevalent in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. However, data regarding the epidemiology of these conditions in Somalia remain limited. This study aims to analyze the patterns of neurological diagnoses among patients admitted to the neurology department of a tertiary referral hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study at Somalia's largest referral hospital in Mogadishu between July 2019 and July 2024. Data were extracted from electronic medical records of adult patients admitted with neurological conditions to the neurology ward, emergency department, and general intensive care units. Pediatric and trauma-related admissions were excluded. Descriptive statistics, Pearson chi-square tests, binary logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were employed to assess the distribution of neurological diagnoses and factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A total of 2,126 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 56.03\u2009\u00b1\u200919.07 years (range: 18-98 years), and the majority were male (n\u2009=\u20091,274; 60%). Most admissions originated from the emergency department (n\u2009=\u20091,741; 82%). Over half of the patients had at least one comorbidity (n\u2009=\u20091,329; 62.5%), with hypertension being the most common (n\u2009=\u2009654; 31%), followed by diabetes mellitus (n\u2009=\u2009175; 8.2%), epilepsy (n\u2009=\u2009138; 6.5%), heart disease (n\u2009=\u2009118; 5.6%), and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (n\u2009=\u200967; 3.2%). The leading neurological diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n\u2009=\u2009905; 42.6%), hemorrhagic stroke (n\u2009=\u2009552; 26%), epileptic disorders (n\u2009=\u2009166; 7.8%), cerebral venous thrombosis (n\u2009=\u2009138; 6.5%), non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (n\u2009=\u200992; 4.2%), and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (n\u2009=\u200947; 2.2%). Intrahospital mortality was recorded in 342 patients (23%). Poor survival outcomes were significantly associated with advanced age, comorbidities, multiple diagnoses, low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, and ICU admission, underscoring the importance of early detection and targeted interventions to reduce mortality. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of neurological admissions in Mogadishu, Somalia-a region with limited healthcare resources. Cerebrovascular diseases and epileptic disorders were the most common diagnoses. The high in-hospital mortality rate emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen preventative and therapeutic strategies targeting non-communicable neurological diseases in low-resource settings."

A total of 245 primary care ophthalmologists participated, with 121 (49.39%) under 44 years old and 114 (46.53%) men. KAP scores and demographic characteristics were collected using a self-designed questionnaire. Mediation analysis was employed to explore relationships within KAP, including the potential impact of physician burnout on knowledge and practice. The average scores for KAP were 12.08\u00b12.02 (possible range: 0-15), 47.77\u00b13.41 (possible range: 11-55) and 28.34\u00b12.35 (possible range: 6-30), respectively. Pearson correlation analysis assessed relationships between variables, revealing positive correlations between knowledge and practice (r=0.368, p<0.001) and attitude and practice (r=0.476, p<0.001). Negative correlations were noted between burnout and both knowledge (r=-0.275, p<0.001) and practice (r=-0.183, p=0.004). Mediation analysis showed that knowledge had a significant direct effect on practice (\u03b2=0.318, p=0.009), while its indirect effect through attitude was not statistically significant (\u03b2=0.058, p=0.224). Attitude had a significant direct effect on practice (\u03b2=0.440, p=0.010). Additionally, the number of cataract surgeries was positively associated with both knowledge (\u03b2=0.234, p=0.012) and practice (\u03b2=0.088, p=0.007), while age was negatively associated with attitude (\u03b2=-0.163, p=0.016) and practice (\u03b2=-0.072, p=0.007). Primary care ophthalmologists showed satisfactory KAP towards fundus examination in diabetic cataract surgery. Further dissemination of guidelines, provision of adequate resources for postoperative follow-up and support for reducing physician burnout are essential.

        "Abstract":"Globally, diabetes mellitus is emerging as one of the most common chronic illnesses, and its prevalence has been increasing in the last decades. International Diabetes Federation reports that the number of people with diabetes in Ethiopia is 1.7 million. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia is rising, and it is expected to increase to 2,031,000 in 2030. Diabetic patients have frequent hospitalization, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess reason for hospitalization and predictors for diabetes related hospitalization and in-hospital treatment outcome of adults with diabetes mellitus in Dilla University, a referral hospital in South Ethiopia. A hospital-based prospective observational study was conducted at medical, emergency, COVID-19 treatment center, and intensive care unit wards of Dilla University Referral Hospital from September 1, 2020, to May 30, 2021. All adult patients with diabetes mellitus who met the inclusion criteria were consecutively included in the study and followed until discharge or referral or death. To identify the predictors for in-hospital treatment outcome and diabetes related admission, logistic regression was run. Variables with p-value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 on multivariate regression were considered statistically significant. A total of 153 patients were enrolled in the study. Diabetic ketoacidosis was the commonest reason for hospitalization (32%), followed by infection (22.2%) and cardiovascular diseases (9.2%). COVID-19 is the major cause of infection-related admission (13.7%). The mean length of hospital stay was 9.92\u2009\u00b1\u20097.97 days, ranging from 2 to 50 days. Higher proportion were discharged with improvement(71.9%) while 15.7% were self-discharge and 12.24% died in the hospital, mainly due to infections. The presence of comorbidity (AOR\u2009=\u20093.27, 95% CI: 1.39-7.68), obesity (AOR\u2009=\u20093.93, 95% CI: 1.42-10.9), patients with age group of 50-59 (AOR\u2009=\u20090.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.56),\u2009\u2265\u200960 (AOR\u2009=\u20090.06, 95% CI: 0.018-0.25), and knowledge about diabetic foot ulcer complication (AOR\u2009=\u20090.33, 95% CI: 0.12-0.89) were predictors of diabetes-related admission. Regarding treatment outcome, poor exercise practice (AOR\u2009=\u20092.41, 95% CI: 1.014-5.77, p\u2009=\u20090.046), hypertension (AOR\u2009=\u20093.17, 95% CI: 1.39-7.19, p\u2009=\u20090.006), unsatisfactory knowledge about DM (AOR\u2009=\u20093.5, 95% CI: 1.12-10.9, p\u2009=\u20090.030), and being unmarried (AOR\u2009=\u20093.34, 95% CI: 1.47-7.58, p\u2009=\u20090.004) were predictors of poor treatment outcome. Generally, this study showed that hyperglycemic emergencies, infections, and cardiovascular diseases were the most common reasons for hospitalization. The mortality rate is high, which is 12.24%, and urges attention to the care of hospitalized patients. Health care professionals should strengthen patient education on glycemic control and self-care practice, since the majority of patients have poor self-care practice and poor metabolic control."

        "Abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the role and potential mechanisms of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac fibrosis using MeRIP-seq.\u00a0A TAC-induced cardiac fibrosis mouse model was established, and cardiac function and structural parameters were assessed by echocardiography four weeks post-surgery. The global m6A methylation levels in myocardial tissues were evaluated using Dot blot analysis, and the expression levels of m6A-modifying enzymes (METTL3, METTL14, ALKBH5, FTO) were detected by qPCR and Western blot. Additionally, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) was performed to identify differentially methylated sites, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses to determine the biological functions and signaling pathways of m6A-methylated genes. The results showed that TAC surgery successfully induced a cardiac fibrosis model in mice, as indicated by significantly reduced EF and LVEF and increased LVIDd and LVIDs. Moreover, m6A methylation levels were elevated in myocardial tissues of TAC mice, accompanied by upregulation of METTL3 and METTL14 expressions and downregulation of ALKBH5 and FTO expression. MeRIP-seq revealed that m6A peaks were primarily enriched in the 3' UTR regions, with 1,466 differentially methylated sites identified between TAC and sham groups, including 717 hypermethylated and 749 hypomethylated sites. Functional enrichment analyses showed that these differentially methylated genes were involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and ion channel activity, and were associated with pathways such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, and insulin signaling. Thus, our findings suggested that m6A methylation played a significant role in TAC-induced cardiac fibrosis by regulating key genes involved in myocardial remodeling and functional impairment."

        "Title":"Integrated machine learning and population attributable fraction analysis of systemic inflammatory indices for mortality risk prediction in diabetes and prediabetes.",
        "Abstract":"Chronic systemic inflammation is a key contributor to cardiometabolic complications in diabetes mellitus (DM) and prediabetes (PreDM). Composite inflammatory indices-including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), platelet-to-hemoglobin ratio (PHR), and aggregate inflammation systemic index (AISI)-have shown prognostic value for mortality. However, their integrated assessment using machine learning and quantification at the population level remain limited. In this retrospective cohort study, 11,304 adults with DM or PreDM from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2005-2018) were analyzed. The primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Associations between inflammatory indices and mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Predictive performance was assessed via Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and population attributable fractions (PAFs) estimated the mortality burden related to systemic inflammation. NLR, MLR, SIRI, SII, and AISI were independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. MLR showed the strongest association (HR: 2.948 and 3.717 for all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively). XGBoost identified SIRI, SII, AISI, MLR, and NLR as key predictors, with SIRI ranked highest for cardiovascular mortality. Inclusion of inflammatory indices improved model discrimination and calibration. PAF analysis suggested that 10-20% of mortality reduction could be attributed to improved inflammatory profiles. Systemic inflammatory indices are independent predictors of mortality in individuals with DM or PreDM. Their integration into machine learning models enhances risk prediction and may inform population-level strategies for cardiometabolic risk stratification."

        "Abstract":"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) can be associated with decline in pulmonary function and nutritional status. Earlier diagnosis of CFRD than offered by annual recommended oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and earlier initiation of insulin may help prevent clinical decline. This retrospective study investigates the utility of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for detection of hyperglycemia in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In this single-center, retrospective study, we analyzed data from 18 patients with CF over age 10 who had an abnormal OGTT and subsequently had at least 24\u2009h of CGM data. EasyGV software was used to calculate multiple measures of CGM variability. Differences in OGTT and CGM measures were explored across four glucose-tolerance groups: indeterminate, fasting hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance (with or without fasting hyperglycemia), and CFRD. Multiple CGM measures correlated with components of the OGTT. Across glucose-tolerance groups, significant differences were observed for the OGTT 2-h glucose (p\u2009=\u20090.002), mean of daily differences from CGM (p\u2009=\u20090.03), and standard deviation from CGM (p\u2009=\u20090.02). Approaching significance was the lability index (p\u2009=\u20090.05) from the CGM data. Glucose management indicator (GMI), continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA), glycemic risk assessment in diabetes equation (GRADE), and average daily risk range (ADRR) showed negative correlations with change in forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1) over the year before OGTT. Markers of glycemic variability may be important variables distinguishing between degrees of abnormal glucose tolerance, including CFRD. This area warrants further research with a larger sample size."

        "Abstract":"Human inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) include disorders characterized by aberrant function or development of the immune system. Recently, interest in the immune and endocrine systems has increased. We aimed to investigate endocrine disorders in patients with IEIs. Data on patients with IEIs diagnosed from 1994 to 2021 at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea were reviewed. Each IEI was classified according to the International Union of Immunological Societies classification, and endocrine issues were reviewed. Of the 169 patients with IEIs, an endocrine evaluation was performed in 130 (76.9%). Thirty-five of the 130 patients (27% of the evaluated group) were diagnosed with at least one endocrine disorder, representing approximately 20% of all IEI patients with cumulative incidence of 32.3% at 20 years and 39.8% at 40 years. Patients with 'diseases of immune dysregulation' showed the highest proportion of endocrine disorders. Additionally, six of these 35 patients had two distinct endocrine conditions. Thyroid involvement was most commonly observed (n = 15), followed by hypogonadism (n = 8), adrenal insufficiency (n = 7), growth hormone deficiency (n = 6), hypoparathyroidism (n = 3), and diabetes (n = 2). We described endocrine disorders in patients with IEIs in Korea. About 20% of IEI patients had endocrine problems. Endocrine evaluations should be considered in IEI patients."

This study aimed to design, develop, and validate a smartphone application to deliver rehabilitation programs to older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study consisted of three phases: (1) Assessment of need, (2) Design and development of the smartphone application, and (3) Evaluation of the smartphone application by content validation. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-A\/V) validated the smartphone application. This validation was performed through direct interaction between the validators and the system, relevant observations were identified, and suggestions were noted during and after the test. The smartphone application consisted of six modules, with content delivered through photos, videos, text, and flyers. Eight experts and twenty-five older adults over 60 years and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus completed the validation. The smartphone application received a good median understandability score of over 90 from experts and over 80 by end users, and a median actionability score of 100 by experts and over 100 by end users on the PEMAT-A\/V. This newly developed smartphone application has been validated and is now ready for evaluation to assess its effectiveness in improving the delivery of rehabilitation programs in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

        "Abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool for advancing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) care, offering dynamic, data-driven methods for early detection, management, and personalized intervention. This systematic review aims to comprehensively explore and synthesize the use of AI models in GDM care, including screening, diagnosis, management, and prediction of maternal and neonatal outcomes. Specifically, we examine (1) study designs and population characteristics; (2) the use of AI across different aspects of GDM care; (3) types of input data used for AI modeling; and (4) AI model types, validation strategies, and performance metrics. A systematic search was conducted across six electronic databases, identifying 126 eligible studies published up to February 2025. Data extraction and quality appraisal were independently conducted by six reviewers, using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool for risk of bias assessment. Among 126 studies, 75% employed retrospective designs, with sample sizes ranging from 17 to over 100 000 participants. Most AI applications (85%) focused on early GDM prediction, while fewer addressed management, outcomes, or monitoring. Classical machine learning dominated (84%), with logistic regression and random forest frequently used. Internal validation was common (68%), but external validation was rare (6%). Our risk of bias appraisal indicated an overall moderate-to-good methodological quality, with notable deficiencies in analysis reporting. AI demonstrates strong potential to improve GDM prediction, screening, and management. Nonetheless, broader validation, enhanced model interpretability, and prospective studies in diverse populations are needed to translate these technologies into clinical practice."

        "Abstract":"Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are global public health challenges. Activating thermogenic adipose tissues, such as brown adipose tissue and beige adipose tissue, could be a promising strategy to combat obesity and consequently obesity-related diabetes. Both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and retinoid X receptor \u03b3 (RXR\u03b3) play significant roles in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation. However, the underlying mechanisms and interactions between these receptors during adipogenic differentiation remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a transcriptome sequencing dataset sourced from the GEO database, encompassing samples of white and brown adipose tissues from 15\u00a0healthy individuals. Our findings reveal that RXR\u03b3 expression is significantly elevated in brown adipose tissue relative to white adipose tissue (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.041). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays validated that RXR\u03b3 can be co-precipitated with PPAR\u03b3. Subsequent luciferase assays demonstrated that the interaction between RXR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b3 significantly enhances the transcriptional activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) compared to the overexpression of PPAR\u03b3 alone (3.4-fold vs. 1.5-fold, <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Notably, in human preadipocytes, the co-overexpression of RXR\u03b3 with PPAR\u03b3 resulted in a significant increase in UCP1 transcriptional activity compared to the overexpression of PPAR\u03b3 alone (3.4-fold vs. 2.0-fold, <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05). In summary, our findings suggest that RXR\u03b3 serves as a novel cofactor for PPAR\u03b3, promoting the browning of adipose tissue through the upregulation of UCP1 transcription."

Conventional risk stratification tools such as the CHA<sub>2<\/sub>DS<sub>2<\/sub>-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years [doubled], diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack [doubled], vascular disease, age 65-74\u00a0years, female sex) score are often insufficient to predict thromboembolic events in patients with HCM and AF, as thromboembolic risk in HCM is driven by disease-specific structural, functional, and prothrombotic substrates. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical impact of AF and thromboembolism in HCM. We discuss variable imaging modalities-including strain echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and cardiac computed tomography-that offer enhanced characterization of atrial remodeling and thromboembolic risk in patients with HCM. Furthermore, we outline current guideline-based anticoagulation strategies, the evolving role of direct oral anticoagulants, and adjunctive therapies such as left atrial appendage occlusion and catheter ablation. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach that incorporates advanced imaging, molecular profiling, and individualized management is ideal to optimize outcomes and reduce stroke burden in patients with HCM and AF."

        "Abstract":"Individuals with diabetes are at high risk of foot complications such as ulcers and amputations, leading to morbidity and economic burden. Effective foot care management reduces complications, highlighting the need for patient education and self-management practices. Interprofessional care (IPC) enhances patient care by integrating expertise from multiple disciplines. While education programs improve self-care and knowledge, their impact on self-efficacy remains unclear. Furthermore, the role of the Interprofessional Collaborative Education Program (IPCEP) in enhancing foot care practices also needs exploration. This narrative review evaluated the usefulness of the interprofessional approach (IPA) to patient-centered education in improving foot care knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane was carried out to explore the importance of IPCEP in improving foot care practices among individuals with T2DM. A narrative review was conducted, as there was a paucity of literature related to studies meeting the criteria by September 23, 2024. Studies assessing patient outcomes (behaviour, attitudes, knowledge) were considered. Extensive research is needed to highlight the importance of IPCEP in improving foot care knowledge and promoting proactive self-management. This is because the IPA positively influences patients\u2019 attitudes toward health management post-education. This review highlights the need for IPCEP to improve foot care practices; thus, it can foster a holistic approach to diabetes and diabetic foot care, improve quality of life, and reduce complications."

        "Abstract":"The global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing, particularly in resource-limited settings like rural China. Although traditional blood glucose remains an essential measurement for diabetes screening, Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) is emerging as a complementary predictor of T2DM risk. Over time, however, the association between AIP and T2DM risk remains insufficiently understood. To investigate the association between baseline AIP levels and its 5-year changes with the risk of T2DM in a rural Chinese cohort. This prospective cohort study enrolled 14,968 participants without baseline diabetes from a rural Chinese population. AIP was calculated (log(TG\/HDL-C)) and used to classify participant results into quartiles. We conducted multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, restricted cubic spline analyses, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses to determine the association between baseline AIP and 5-year changes in AIP with the 10-year risk of T2DM. Over a median follow-up of 10.4 years, 2,165(N\u2009=\u200914,968) participants developed T2DM. The hazard ratios [aHRs; 95% confidence interval (CI)] for T2DM increased with quartiles 2, 3, and 4 (versus quartile 1) of AIP: 1.17 (1.00-1.38), 1.38 (1.18-1.62), and 1.96 (1.68-2.29), respectively (p for trend\u2009<\u20090.0001) after multivariable adjustment. Regarding 5-year changes in AIP, participants with increased AIP levels had a 18% higher risk of developing T2DM (aHRs 1.18, 95% CIs: 1.00-1.40) compared to those maintaining stable levels, while those with decreased AIP showed a 20% reduction in risk (aHRs 0.80, 95% CIs: 0.67-0.95). RCS analyses showed linear relationships for both baseline AIP (p for nonlinearity\u2009=\u20090.927) and 5-year changes in AIP (p for nonlinearity\u2009=\u20090.083) with T2DM risk. Our findings indicate that both baseline AIP levels and the 5-year changes in those levels are significantly associated with the risk of T2DM. Individuals with higher baseline AIP or 5-year increases in AIP were more likely to develop T2DM."

Although the link between RST and NODM is still debated, there is a lack of effective strategies to predict and prevent potential RST-induced NODM in clinical practice. This study aimed to determine the association between plasma exposure to RST and the risk of developing NODM in patients with cardiovascular disease and to establish predictive models for the early detection of RST-induced NODM. We included 704 patients with cardiovascular disease and without diabetes who had been on RST for\u2009>\u20094 months. We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect the concentration of RST and its metabolites. We then used machine learning (ML) to analyze the impact of plasma exposure to RST and patient characteristics on NODM and established four risk prediction models for RST-induced NODM. The optimal model was determined using the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the Shapley algorithm (SHAP) interpretation. Our findings indicated that high plasma exposure to RST was an independent risk factor for NODM. In terms of NODM, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest AUC value (0.7310) in the testing set and was validated as the best performing model. The SHAP analysis identified high triglyceride levels, advanced age, and high RST plasma exposure as the top three predictors of NODM. In addition, low total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were also associated with an increased risk of NODM. The study findings revealed high plasma exposure of RST as an independent risk factor for NODM in patients without diabetes who are on RST, which may relate to \"on-target\" effects of RST. In addition, ML interpreted using SHAP provide valuable tools for early prediction and personalized management of RST-induced NODM."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of prediabetes among attendees at Palestinian primary health care (PHC) centers and identify associated factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted in PHC centers in the West Bank from February to June 2024. A total of 635 participants, representing both sexes, were recruited from six PHC centers, two from each of the three main regions of the West Bank, including one central and one peripheral center per region. Prediabetes was diagnosed through HbA1c testing. Associated factors were assessed through face-to-face interviews using the validated Canadian Diabetes Risk Questionnaire (CANRISK). The overall prevalence of prediabetes among PHC attendees was 13.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 11.0-16.3%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified several factors significantly associated with prediabetes. These included central obesity (adjusted Odss Ratio (aOR)\u2009=\u20094.2; 95% CI: 1.3-13.9), male sex (aOR\u2009=\u20094.5; 95% CI: 2.1-9.7), older age (aOR\u2009=\u200924.1; 95% CI: 7.9-73.7), and a family history of diabetes (aOR\u2009=\u20094.3; 95% CI: 1.6-12.2).

        "Abstract":"The interactions between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and major histocompatibility complex molecules may significantly influence autoimmune diseases due to their common roles in the evolution and development of the adaptive immune system. Notably, regions within the Gag antigens of a specific group of ERVs, similar to murine leukemia retroviruses, exhibit patterns of sequence conservation, variation, and mutation. One highly conserved peptide of Gag, p5-13 (VTTPLSLTL), binds with high affinity to a nonclassic major histocompatibility complex molecule, Qa-1, and is preferentially recognized by T cells enriched in the pancreas of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which spontaneously develop autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, deep sequencing analysis of the Gag genes expressed in NOD mice has revealed numerous mutations flanking the conserved Qa-1-binding sequences. This includes 1 epitope, p310-328, which contains both conserved and mutated residues that can elicit autoreactive T cells in NOD mice. A specific residue, D316, within this epitope accumulates multiple mutations as the disease progresses, leading to a reduction in the consensus score in sequence alignment at this position during the later stages of prediabetes. Consistently, the substitution of the D316 residue with a dominant mutant, G316, enhances the antigenicity of this epitope, stimulating autoreactive T cells in prediabetic NOD mice to release interferon-\u03b3 . Thus, sequence variants of ERV Gag antigens encode overlapping conserved and highly mutated epitopes that can be recognized by T cells and utilized for biomarker discovery."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study reviewing clinical characteristics, microbiology and outcomes of BSIs in patients receiving HD from 1 December 2017 to 1 December 2023 using data from an integrated network of dialysis sites. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted, as well as Kaplan-Meier analysis for survival. Of 1461 patients who received HD over the study period, 171 positive blood cultures occurred in 137 patients. Sixty blood cultures (35%) were considered non-significant contaminants, leaving 111 significant BSIs in 97 patients. Patients with BSIs had a median age of 65\u2009years (interquartile range [IQR]: 50-76); 61% were males, with 48% having diabetes mellitus and 57% cardiovascular disease. A high proportion of BSI episodes (66\/111, 59%) were determined to be HD access-associated, primarily in patients with central venous catheters (55\/111, 50%). The most frequent non-HD access-associated sources were intra-abdominal\/biliary (9%) and urinary (8%). Staphylococcus aureus (25%) was the most isolated organism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermis (12%). Polymicrobial BSI occurred in 10% of episodes. Median hospitalisation length was 9\u2009days (IQR: 6-15). Mortality at 90\u2009days was high (24%), and on multivariate analysis was associated with increasing age (odds ratio: 1.06 per year [IQR: 1.01-1.10]). BSIs remain a major issue in patients receiving HD, contributing to prolonged hospitalisations and high mortality rates. HD access-associated BSIs account for a substantial proportion of BSIs and remain a pertinent target for intervention."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes risk is disproportionately higher among structurally marginalized communities, partly due to influences from social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. Individual-level diabetes prevention strategies address proximal factors, such as modifiable behaviors, often overlooking the role of multilevel socioecological factors that contribute to diabetes risk and inequities. Multilevel diabetes prevention interventions involve actions that address multiple health determinants across the individual, community, and systemic levels of influence, offering a promising approach to reducing inequities in diabetes risk. This scoping review aimed to systematically map the types of health determinants addressed in multilevel diabetes prevention interventions that have been implemented for addressing population inequities in diabetes risk and to describe what evidence exists regarding their effectiveness. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and gray literature sources (websites of government agencies and local\/international nongovernmental health organizations) for studies published from the year 2000 to 2024. The research team developed a conceptual framework to guide the scoping review and define multilevel interventions for eligibility. Eligibility criteria included studies focusing on multilevel diabetes prevention interventions targeting diabetes relevant risk factors at more than one level of influence (micro, meso, and macro) and where intervention outcomes were reported. Data extraction included study characteristics, intervention target populations and coverage, targeted health determinants, and intervention outcomes and was completed by 2 independent reviewers. Data synthesis involved mapping health determinants addressed by each multilevel intervention according to our conceptual framework and a narrative synthesis of findings on themes corresponding to intervention types and reported outcomes. Of 7813 articles retrieved, a total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions consisted of targeted interventions for high-risk populations (n=7), environmental-based interventions (n=7), and community-based interventions (n=11). Most interventions addressed health determinants at 2 levels (micro and macro) (14\/25, 56%) or 3 levels (micro, meso, and macro) (11\/25, 44%). All studies reported on proximal outcomes, most frequently on weight, physical activity, and dietary behaviors. One-third (8\/25, 32%) of studies reported outcomes on changes in metabolic risk. None of the studies reported on equity outcomes related to changes in population inequities in diabetes incidence. Only 8% (n=2) of studies reported an equity outcome that captures disparities in a diabetes risk factor level between disadvantaged and advantaged population groups. Our review identified a research gap in that outcomes on population inequities in diabetes risk have not been consistently measured in multilevel diabetes prevention interventions, and the impact of these interventions on reducing population inequities in diabetes incidence is not consistently examined or reported. Future research should prioritize equity outcomes in evaluations of multilevel diabetes prevention interventions and emphasize impacts on disadvantaged populations and population inequities."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex, chronic condition that requires ongoing management. An important aspect of effective diabetes management is shared decision-making between the person with diabetes and the health care professionals (HCPs) to tailor individual treatment plans. Personal health technologies can play a crucial role in this collaborative effort by providing tools for monitoring, communication, and education. This study aims to test the clinical feasibility of DiaFocus, a mobile health system developed for adults with T2D. This was a single-arm, prospective, 6-month pilot study in a clinical outpatient setting at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Denmark. The DiaFocus system includes an app for the participants and a web portal for the HCPs. The system collects diabetes-related data, including participant-reported lifestyle surveys, sensor-based measures on physical activity, and participant-selected focus areas, aiming to support communication and shared decision-making at clinical visits. Participants were eligible if they were \u226518 years old, diagnosed with T2D\u226512 months, spoke Danish, and had a smartphone (iOS 13+ or Android 8.0+). For each participant, 3 visits and 1 telephone call were scheduled during the 6-month study period. The DiaFocus system's acceptability and feasibility were assessed through retention rates, app usage, participant feedback, and by the CACHET Unified Method for Assessment of Clinical Feasibility (CUMACF) questionnaire. The clinical outcomes were assessed by the following questionnaires: Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), Perceived Competence for Diabetes (PCDS), Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs+c), hemoglobin A1c levels, and body weight. A total of 17 participants with T2D were included in the study, 15 completed the study, and data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The median age was 68 (IQR 56-72) years, 12 (71%) were males, the median diabetes duration was 18 (IQR 11-21) years, and the median hemoglobin A1c was 59 (IQR 49-68) mmol\/mol. Participants found the DiaFocus system feasible to support diabetes management despite technical problems, and they valued the ability to set focus areas. The most common focus areas were \"blood glucose\" (n=10, 59%) and \"exercise\" (n=9, 53%), but areas such as \"sleep\" and \"mood\" were also used. The CUMACF questionnaire showed that 90% (9\/10) of the participants had very favorable views of how easy the system is to understand, learn, and use, and 80% (8\/10) of the participants agreed or strongly agreed that the system was useful. Feedback was generally positive, indicating participants would use a refined version. Despite these findings, no statistically significant changes in clinical outcomes were observed throughout the study period using the DiaFocus system. This pilot study demonstrated that the DiaFocus system is clinically feasible and acceptable for users with T2D, although there is a need for optimization of app functionality and stability."

To describe the use of velagliflozin in cats with DM and hypersomatotropism. Eight client-owned cats with DM and hypersomatotropism treated with velagliflozin. Retrospective multicentric case series. Clinical data, including diabetic clinical score, insulin dose, and continuous glucose monitoring-derived metrics were compared between the last follow-up before velagliflozin introduction (T0) and the first (T1) and last (T2) follow-ups after velagliflozin introduction. Diabetic clinical score improved in 6\/8 cats after velagliflozin initiation. Median daily insulin dose decreased from 1.9\u2009U\/kg (range 0.8-7.1) at T0 to 0.5\u2009U\/kg (0-2.3) at T1 (median difference [MD]\u2009=\u2009-1.2\u2009U\/kg; 95% CI: -5.2 to 0.5; p\u2009=\u20090.02). Mean glucose was lower both at T1 (207\u2009mg\/dL, 96-326) and T2 (273\u2009mg\/dL, 155-350) than at T0 (435\u2009mg\/dL, 298-477; MD\u2009=\u2009-177\u2009mg\/dL, 95% CI: -238 to -92, p\u2009=\u20090.008 and MD\u2009=\u2009-113\u2009mg\/dL, 95% CI: -280 to -18, p\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively).

This cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 3\u2009years at the Soavinandriana Hospital Center. Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function 5-item version (IIEF-5) questionnaire, with a score of less than 22 indicating ED. The presence of ASCVD was confirmed in cases where carotid atherosclerosis (CAS), lower limb arteriopathy (LLA), coronary heart disease (CHD) and\/or ischaemic stroke were present. The study population included 305 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) was 73.4%.

After adjusting for age, hypertension, physical inactivity, smoking and dyslipidemia, ED was significantly associated with ASCVD (OR 1.88 (1.01-3.69)), and CAS (OR 1.89 (1.03-3.22)). Adjusting for age, type and duration of DM, ED was found to be significantly associated with ASCVD (OR 1.91 (1.01-3.58)) and CAS (OR 2.31 (1.11-4.85)). However, there was no statistically significant association between ED, LLA, CHD and ischaemic stroke. ED was very common and may be a predictor of ASCVD in patients with DM, particularly CAS. Consequently, the presence of ED should prompt the search for ASCVD, and vice versa."

This study aimed to evaluate whether CGM use in combination with anti-diabetes medications is associated with changes in A1c among people with type 2 diabetes not using insulin. This was a retrospective, observational analysis of administrative claims and linked laboratory data from Optum's Clinformatics Data Mart database. The study observation period covered 01\/07\/2018 through 30\/06\/2023 with 6-month baseline and follow-up periods. CGM use in conjunction with \u2265\u20091 of five anti-diabetes medication classes: metformin, sulfonylureas, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and\/or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) was required. The primary outcome was change in A1c from baseline. Linear regression models tested the main and interaction effects of CGM and each anti-diabetes medication. Overall, 52,394 CGM-na\u00efve adults with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes using anti-diabetes medications were identified (4086 CGM users; 48,308 CGM non-users). CGM use was associated with a\u2009-0.45% greater A1c change among CGM users compared to CGM non-users (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). After adjusting for covariates, CGM users experienced greater A1c reductions vs. CGM non-users with all medications, but statistically significant interactions showed that for DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs and sulfonylureas, there were greater decreases in A1c for CGM users vs. CGM non-users who were taking the medication compared to CGM users vs. CGM non-users who were not taking the medication. A1c change between CGM users vs. CGM non-users did not vary by metformin or SGLT2 inhibitor use. The findings suggest that CGM use could augment the glycaemic benefits of anti-diabetes medications in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes. These results support broader adoption of CGM."

As antibodies are unable to distinguish NRXN family members and isoforms, the purpose of this study was to investigate differential expression of individual NRXN transcripts in relevant retinal cell types in early DRD. RNAscope multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to quantify transcripts of NRXNs in mouse and human retina. DM was induced in C57BL\/6J mice using streptozotocin (STZ) and the retinal phenotype characterized by electroretinogram (ERG), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and optokinetic tracking (OKT) after 6 weeks. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were generated in vitro by directed differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), cultured in normal or high glucose, and NRXN expression assessed by qPCR and Western blot. All NRXN family members (NRXN1, NRXN2, and NRXN3) were enriched in inner retinal neurons in both human and mouse tissue. We identified decreased Nrxn3 transcripts, specifically the Nrxn3\u03b2 isoform, in RGCs of diabetic mice at 6 weeks after STZ treatment. Interestingly, Nrxn3\u03b1 and Nrxn3\u03b2 were differentially expressed in inner retinal layers. Finally, we confirmed decreased Nrxn3\u03b2 expression in hESC-RGCs cultured in high glucose in vitro. Our findings suggest that NRXNs may play cell-type-specific roles in the inner retina and associate decreased Nrxn3\u03b2 expression in RGCs with inner retinal dysfunction in early DRD."

Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) was adopted for image acquisition. An AI-based algorithm conducted quantitative analyses of photoreceptor morphology, including cone density, spacing, and regularity. Vessel morphology (inner diameter, outer diameter, wall thickness, wall-to-lumen ratio [WLR]) was manually assessed. The arteriolar index ratio (AIR) was derived to assess arteriolar remodeling. Generalized estimating equation was utilized to compare the differences of inner diameter, outer diameter, wall thickness, WLR and the AIR among healthy control, DM and DR groups. Thirty patients, consisting of 9 healthy controls, 11 with DM, and 10 with DR, were evaluated (mean [SD] age, 66.33(7.02). A significant reduction in photoreceptor cell density in macular areas correlated with the presence of DM (P=0.033) and DR (P=0.006). Notably, a significant increase of the wall thickness was observed. These variations were pronounced in the arteriole segments of diabetic patients (P<0.001) and escalated with the presence of DR (P=0.018). Accounting for WLR, the DR group showed a significantly larger ratio comparing to control group (P=0.011). The AIR in small retinal arterioles differed significantly among DR (P<0.001), DM (P=0.024) and control groups. AOSLO imaging showed delineating retinal photoreceptor and arteriolar alterations throughout DR progression, potentially serving as a predictive measure for anatomical or functional retinal changes in DM and DR patients."

        "Title":"The Duodenum-Centered Neurohormonal Hypothesis of Type 2 Diabetes: A Mechanistic Review and Therapeutic Perspective.",
        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial disorder defined by insulin resistance, \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and chronic hyperglycemia. Although peripheral mechanisms have been extensively studied, increasing evidence implicates the gastrointestinal tract in disease onset. Insights from bariatric surgery, gut hormone signaling, and incretin-based therapies suggest that the gut contributes actively beyond nutrient absorption. Yet, a cohesive framework integrating these observations remains absent, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of T2DM's upstream pathophysiology. This work builds upon the anti-incretin theory, which posits that nutrient-stimulated neurohormonal signals-termed \"anti-incretins\"-arise from the proximal intestine to counteract incretin effects and regulate glycemic homeostasis. The excess of anti-incretin signals, perhaps stimulated by macronutrient composition or chemical additives of modern diets, disrupts this balance and may cause insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell depletion, leading to T2D. We hypothesize that the neuroendocrine signals produced by cholecystokinin (CCK)-I and secretin-S cells, both located in the proximal intestine, function as endogenous anti-incretins. In this context, we hypothesize a novel model centered on the chronic overstimulation of I and S cells by high-fat, high glycemic index modern diets. This drives what we term \"amplified digestion\"-a state marked by heightened vagal and hormonal stimulation of biliary and pancreatic secretions, increased enzymatic and bile acid activity, and alterations in bile acid composition. This condition leads to an extended breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins into absorbable units, thereby promoting excessive nutrient absorption and ultimately contributing to insulin resistance and progressive \u03b2-cell failure. Multiple lines of clinical, surgical, and experimental evidence converge to support our model, rooted in the physiology of digestion and absorption. Western dietary patterns appear to induce an over-digestive adaptation-marked by excessive vagal and hormonal stimulation of biliary and pancreatic secretion-which amplifies digestive signaling. This heightened state correlates with increased nutrient absorption, insulin resistance, and \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Interventions that disrupt this maladaptive signaling-such as truncal vagotomy combined with duodenal bypass-may offer novel, physiology-based strategies for T2DM treatment. This hypothesis outlines a potential upstream contributor to insulin resistance and T2DM, grounded in digestive tract-derived neurohormonal dysregulation. This gut-centered model may provide insight into early, potentially reversible stages of the disease and identify a conceptual therapeutic target. Nonetheless, both the hypothesis and the accompanying surgical strategy-truncal vagotomy combined with proximal intestinal bypass-remain highly exploratory and require systematic validation through mechanistic and clinical studies. Further investigation is warranted to clarify the molecular regulation of I and S enteroendocrine cells, including the genetic and epigenetic factors that may drive hypersecretion. While speculative, interventions-surgical or pharmacologic-designed to modulate these digestive signals could represent a future avenue for research into T2DM prevention or remission, pending rigorous evidence."

PPGRs can vary significantly between individuals, even when consuming the same foods, due to the diverse and complex nature of individual characteristics. However, to date, system-scale studies investigating the variability of PPGRs in people living with T2DM are scarce. This research collected meal logs, continuous glucose monitoring records, clinicodemographic profiles, and gut microbiota data comprising over 2,000 real-life meals across 88 individuals with T2DM, revealing causal relationships in the diet-microbiome-PPGR interplay. Furthermore, we developed a multimodal deep learning predictive PPGR model that integrates heterogeneous input data. The proposed model achieves R of 0.62 and 0.66 for 2- and 4-h PPGR prediction, respectively, significantly surpassing the perfor-mance of the carbohydrate single predictor and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. This model substantially improved the prediction in the subgroup of low responders to carbohydrates, a traditionally challenging population for accurate prediction using carbohydrate-based methods. This advancement empowers personalized PPGR prediction, laying the foundation for precision nutrition and better glycemic management for individuals with T2DM."

From the inpatient databases in Japan from September 2021 to March 2023, which includes the era following the development of COVID-19 vaccines, we extracted data from 168,370 patients with COVID-19 aged 20-\u2009<\u200980\u00a0years with diabetes mellitus treated with oral antidiabetic agents. The primary and secondary outcomes were 100-day in-hospital mortality and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalisation, respectively. We compared outcomes in patients who received BG with those who did not using a logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards under both propensity score-unmatched and matched cohorts. The incidence of in-hospital death was significantly lower in the BG group (1.18%) compared with the non-BG group (2.41%) (P\u2009<\u20090.001).

        "Abstract":"We aimed to examine and establish the psychometric properties of the Urdu version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. A standard forward-backwards translation procedure was adopted. The Urdu (lingua franca of Pakistan) version of BIPQ was approved by an independent expert panel and committee review. The intraclass correlation (ICC) established the consistency of the retained items in the questionnaire. The test-retest reliability for the pilot and field study was identified by using Cronbach's coefficient. An Exploratory Factor Analysis, conducted using principal axis factoring extraction and oblique rotation with Kaiser normalization, was employed to validate the BIPQ in Urdu. The open-ended section of the BIPQ was discussed for reliability and validity through the Delphi method. The 8-item translated version (later termed the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire in Urdu, or BIPQ-U) exhibited an acceptable Cronbach's alpha value of 0.814 (test) and 0.800 (re-test). The ICC for all eight items exhibited exceptional coefficient values of > 0.80. Internal consistency during the field study was also acceptable (\u03b1 = 0.815). The appropriateness of psychometric assessment was confirmed through the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (0.855) and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (p<0.05). A statistically significant difference between females and males (p = 0.025) confirmed the discriminative validity through Mann-Whitney <i>U<\/i>-test. Based on initial eigenvalues > 1, four factors were extracted, accounting for a total variance of 75.96%. With acceptable commonalities of >0.30, all eight items of BIPQ-U were retained. Lastly, members of the Delphi group reached a mutual consensus on adding question number 9 to the validated BIPQ-U. The BIPQ-U is a reliable tool for assessing illness perception among Urdu-speaking patients. It can help healthcare providers better understand patient beliefs and improve care."

This study examined the relationship between food skills, diabetes self-management, and stress with medically underinsured patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus within the Fresh Start Food is Medicine (FIM) program. A secondary objective was to examine the impact on diet quality and clinical outcomes. Adults (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u2009150) with type-2 diabetes mellitus participated in the 20-week Fresh Start FIM intervention, which included nine group education classes, a produce prescription, and telephone-based health coaching. Group education and skill-building centered around food skills and diabetes self-management. Measures included surveys (e.g., food skills confidence, diet quality, and stress) and clinical measures (e.g., weight, HbA1c, and blood pressure). Data analysis included paired <i>t<\/i>-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and linear regression. Significant improvements were observed in food skills confidence (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001), diet quality (e.g., fruit <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.03; vegetable <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001; whole grain <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001 consumption), diabetes self-management (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001), and perceived stress (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.01). Food skills confidence and diabetes self-management were significant predictors of perceived stress (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.05 and 0.009, respectively).

        "Abstract":"Although obesity has been implicated in the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the relationship remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify the association between visceral fat area (VFA) and large nerve fiber dysfunction, as estimated by vibration perception threshold (VPT), in young and middle-aged Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This cross-sectional study enrolled 501 adults aged 18-65 years with T2DM between March 2020 and August 2024. Visceral fat area was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis, and large nerve fiber dysfunction was evaluated via vibration perception threshold measurement. Multivariable logistic regression, generalized additive models, smooth curve fitting, and two-piecewise regression analyses were employed to explore the relationship between VFA and VPT. Among the participants, 27.5% exhibited abnormal VPT. After adjustment for potential confounders, a nonlinear J-shaped association between VFA and VPT was observed. Two-piecewise logistic regression revealed a turning point at 133.9 cm\u00b2 with a significant threshold effect (P for log-likelihood ratio test = 0.020). Below this threshold, VFA showed no significant association with abnormal VPT (OR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90-1.11; P = 0.978). However, above this threshold, each 10 cm\u00b2 increase in VFA was associated with a 22% higher risk of abnormal VPT (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.07-1.40; P = 0.003). Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were not significant (all P\u2009>\u20090.05). In young and middle-aged patients with T2DM, the relationship between visceral fat accumulation and large nerve fiber dysfunction exhibits a J-shaped curve. Notably, VFA exceeding the defined threshold of 133.9 cm\u00b2 significantly increased the risk of impaired nerve function as measured by VPT."

        "Abstract":"At present, increasing evidence has reported circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential clinical biomarkers for specific diseases and administration of pharmaceutical agents. The main aim of this study was to compare the effect of two selected home-based resistance exercise (HBRE) and game-based exercise training (GBET) groups on microRNA21-5p expression and biomarkers related to non-alcoholic fatty liver in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Twenty children with T1D aged 10-15 years were randomly assigned to one of two groups (HBRE: n = 10; GBET: n = 10). The exercise training lasted for 8 weeks with three sessions per week. The liver enzyme profile, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glucose, microRNA-21-5p, insulin, and Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) levels were measured before and after the interventions in both groups. In addition, the cardiopulmonary fitness and body fat percentage (BF%) of the participants were also evaluated. After exercise interventions, miR-21-5p increased significantly for both intervention groups (HBRE: 8.9% vs. GBET: 6.7%; <i>P<\/i> = 0.001). The levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (HBRE: 60.71% vs. GBET: 49.15%) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymes (HBRE: 54.02% vs. GBET: 34.02%), the glucose (HBRE: 15.03% vs. GBET: 16.26%), and the HbA1c (HBRE: -10.44% vs. GBET: -6.52%) were decreased significantly (<i>P<\/i> \u2264 0.05). The cardiorespiratory endurance of subjects increased (HBRE: 2.85% vs. GBET: 3.75%), but there were no differences between groups (<i>P<\/i> \u2265 0.05).

In total, 292 children with obesity and T2DM were enrolled between July 2023 and February 2024 and followed for at least 1 year. Eight ML algorithms (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron, Adaptive Boosting, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) were compared for their capacity to identify key clinical and laboratory characteristics of T2DM in children and to create a risk prediction model. Forty-nine children were diagnosed with T2DM during the follow-up period. The SVM algorithm was the best predictor of T2DM, with the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.98) and accuracy (93.2%). The SVM algorithm identified eight predictors: BMI, creatinine, prealbumin, glucose (180 min), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, thyrotropin, total thyroxine (T4), and free T4 concentrations. Thus, an ML-based prediction model accurately identifies children with obesity at high risk of T2DM. If externally validated, this tool could facilitate early, personalized interventions aimed at preventing T2DM. The rising prevalence of obesity in childhood is associated with an increase in the risk of early-onset T2DM. Therefore, the early identification of individuals at high risk is crucial to prevent the development of this disease. In a comparative analysis of the performance of multiple ML algorithms, we found that the SVM algorithm was the best predictor of the development of T2DM."

Data on the burden of CKD-T2DM were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) were estimated by sex, age, region, SDI, and specifically in China. The trends of ASIR were assessed using Joinpoint model to calculate the average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) and their 95% confidence intervals. Prediction was conducted using the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model. In 2019, the ASIR of global CKD-T2DM increased with age in both sexes, and was highest in the older 75 age group. The ASIR of CKD-T2DM in males was higher than those in females. Overall, the global ASIR of CKD-T2DM increased from 1990 to 2019 in both sexes and all age groups. The most significant increase was observed in the 15-49 age group [males: AAPC=1.42, 95%CI:(1.35-1.49); females: AAPC=1.18,95%CI:(1.13-1.23)]. Besides, the upward trends in ASIR of CKD-T2DM were observed in most SDI regions and GBD regions. The changing trends in ASIR of CKD-T2DM in China were similar to the global trends. Finally, the predicted ASIR was also found to be increased globally and also in China in both sex from 2020 to 2030. The global CKD-T2DM incidence rates increased from 1990 to 2019 in both sexes, most regions and in China., and also increased globally between 2020 and 2030. Therefore, it is important to input more medical resources and establish prevention strategies for the increasing trends of CKD-T2DM."

A total of 413 individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at Suqian First Hospital's Endocrinology Department were included in this study. These participants were divided into training and validation groups in a 7:3 ratio, consisting of 289 and 124 patients respectively. In the training cohort, potential predictive variables were determined through both univariate and multivariate analyses utilizing forward-backward stepwise selection. Only variables with p < 0.05 were included in the nomogram, which encompassed demographic information, clinical laboratory results, and diabetes-associated complications. The performance of the model was evaluated in both groups using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to determine clinical utility. Out of 20 clinical variables examined, five were chosen to develop the nomogram: RBC, serum creatinine (SCR), diabetes duration, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The ROC analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for the training cohort was 0.765 (95% CI 0.709-0.821) and for the validation cohort was 0.707 (95% CI 0.616-0.798).

Data from the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed using weighted logistic regression, subgroup analysis, restricted cubic splines, mediation analysis, and other methods. Among 1,260 diabetic patients, HRR was inversely associated with DR development (OR = 0.85, P = 0.008), remaining significant post-propensity score matching. A non-linear relationship was identified, with an inflection point at HRR = 10.81 (P for non-linearity < 0.001), above which the protective effect strengthened with increasing HRR. Mediation analyses revealed diastolic blood pressure (15.9% mediation) and HbA1c (60.5% competitive mediation) as partial mediators of the HRR-DR association.

Recently, the innate immune system, particularly neutrophils and the process of NET formation, has garnered significant attention for its role in the progression of T2DKD in patients with T2DM. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We employed single-cell LacNAc sequencing (scLacNAc-seq) to characterize immune cell populations, glycosylation patterns, and functional alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), focusing on low-density granulocytes (LDGs), from patients with T2DM and T2DKD versus healthy controls (HC). <i>In vitro<\/i> cultures of primary human neutrophils under high glucose and high glucose plus serum from patients with T2DKD were used to assess NET formation via myeloperoxidase (MPO) detection. Plasma levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), CXCL8, CXCR2, MPO, and neutrophil elastase (NE) were quantified by ELISA. Patients with T2DM and T2DKD showed increased LDG counts and glycosylation abundance in FOLR3- and PI3-expressing subclusters. Functional enrichment analysis of overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and subclusters revealed enrichment in NET formation pathways. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies promoted NET release, as evidenced by reduced intracellular MPO and elevated supernatant MPO under hyperglycemic conditions. Plasma ROS, CXCL8, CXCR2, MPO, and NE levels were elevated in patients with T2DM and T2DKD than in HCs. Furthermore, enhanced interactions between neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), primarily mediated by the CXCL8\/CXCR2 axis, were observed. This study identifies immunological alterations in T2DM and T2DKD, implicating neutrophil-mediated inflammation and NET formation in T2DKD progression. Correlative data suggest that targeting ROS and the CXCL8\/CXCR2 pathway may represent potential therapeutic directions, though preclinical validation is warranted."

Methods This quality improvement review was conducted to evaluate the PV status of patients who were hospitalized for pneumococcal disease from January 2023 through June 2024. Eligibility for PV was based on the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s 2025 adult immunization schedule. PV history was identified through the California Immunization Registry. The primary endpoint was PV coverage in patients hospitalized for pneumococcal disease. Secondary endpoints included 14-day all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and opportunities for vaccination at KM prior to admission. Results Thirty-five patients were hospitalized for pneumococcal disease at KM, including 18 cases of bacteremia. The mean age was 54 years, 77% were male, and 54% were Hispanic\/Latino. Twenty-five patients met CDC criteria for PV; however, 92% of these patients were unvaccinated (68%) or undervaccinated (24%). Eight patients died within 14 days of positive culture, seven of whom were unvaccinated but eligible for PV. Mean LOS was 14 days with seven ICU days. Of the 23 unvaccinated or undervaccinated patients, the most common criteria met for PV included age (70%), chronic liver disease or alcoholism (35%), and diabetes mellitus (26%); only four patients between 50-64 years met criteria based on age alone. Of these, only five had primary care encounters at KM within one year of admission. Discussion Despite significant improvement in general incidence and outcomes of pneumococcal disease due to PV, vaccination rates still lag in minority communities and those with underlying medical conditions. The resultant and potentially avoidable impact on mortality and healthcare resources should serve as a call-to-action for public health and key stakeholders, including community pharmacies, to capture and augment opportunities for vaccination in these vulnerable populations. Conclusion This quality improvement review underscores significant gaps in pneumococcal vaccination coverage among adults hospitalized with pneumococcal disease at a safety-net hospital. Despite clear eligibility, the vast majority of the patients remained unvaccinated or undervaccinated prior to admission.\u00a0However, achieving meaningful improvement in vaccine uptake will require a collaborative effort by public health agencies, hospital systems, and community partners to build trust, reduce vaccine hesitancy, and implement sustainable, equity-centered vaccination initiatives."

Variables with a <i>p<\/i>-value less than 0.05, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, were used to declare statistical significance. This study found that 27.0% (95% CI: 0.23-0.31) of the pregnant women were aware of GDM. The most common source of information about GDM was friends at 53.2%, followed by family and healthcare professionals. Factors such as partner involvement [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\u2009=\u20090.58; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(0.35-0.95)], family history of chronic medical conditions [AOR\u2009=\u20095.20; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(2.40-11.25)], mistimed but wanted pregnancies [AOR\u2009=\u20093.36; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(1.40-8.10)], and being Muslim [AOR\u2009=\u20092.89; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(1.34-6.24)] were significantly associated with awareness of GDM. Only a small proportion of pregnant women were aware of GDM. Mistimed but desired pregnancies, partner involvement, and family history of chronic medical conditions were significantly associated with GDM awareness. In order to mitigate the growing burden of GDM, healthcare professionals need to do more to educate women about GDM during their prenatal care follow-ups."

        "Abstract":"S-palmitic acid-9-hydroxy stearic acid (SP), a newly characterized endogenous lipid with multifaceted biological activities, is poised to shed light on its potential in diabetes-related cognitive disorder (DRCD). This study aims to uncover the effects of SP on DRCD and the underlying mechanisms. C57BL\/6 mice were fed with high-fat diet for 5\u202fmonths to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Subsequently, they received bilateral hippocampal injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) shRNA or control shRNA. Following one-month treatment with SP or vehicle, cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. Oxidative stress and apoptosis were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and hippocampal neuronal morphology was examined through HE, Nissl, or NeuN staining. RNA sequencing (RNA seq), cell viability, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) staining, and mitoSOX assays were also performed in cultured PC12 cells. Our findings demonstrated that CAIII played a pivotal role in enhancing cognitive function in T2DM mice by improving spatial memory. SP ameliorated hippocampal injury by CAIII-mediated AMPK\/Sirt1\/PGC1\u03b1 pathway, Bcl-2\/Bax ratio elevation, and cleaved-Caspase 3 reduction. CAIII participated in various biological processes in the effects of SP on PC12 cells, including cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, antioxidant enzymes, the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the reduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our study revealed that CAIII was integral to the effects of SP on DRCD, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for DRCD."

        "Abstract":"The plantar fascia (PF) is a critical load-bearing structure of the foot, contributing to arch support and gait mechanics. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and plantar fasciitis (PFis) are two distinct conditions that affect the structure and function of the PF. While PFis is typically linked to mechanical overload and localized degeneration, diabetes may lead to more widespread changes in connective tissue consistency and thickness. Although both conditions impact PF morphology, no meta-analysis to date has systematically distinguished the ultrasound features of diabetic fascial thickening versus plantar fasciitis, highlighting a critical gap that this study addresses. This case-control ultrasound study included 90 participants aged 30-60 years (30 per group): (1) healthy controls, (2) patients with type 2 DM (duration five or more years, no heel pain), and (3) non-diabetic individuals with clinically diagnosed unilateral PFis. High-resolution ultrasound was performed to assess PF thickness was measured 1\u202fcm distal to the calcaneal insertion (a standardized site with good reproducibility), echogenicity (normal vs. reduced), and power Doppler vascularity. The examiner was blinded to group assignment. Group comparisons were conducted using ANOVA and chi-square tests. PF thickness was significantly increased in both diabetic (3.4 \u00b1 0.6 mm) and PFis (5.6 \u00b1 1.1 mm) groups compared to controls (2.6 \u00b1 0.5 mm, p<0.001). Hypoechogenicity was observed in 90% of PFis subjects but only 7% of individuals with diabetes and none of the controls (p<0.001). Doppler vascularity was absent in controls and nearly all diabetics (3%) but present in 33% of PFis cases (p < 0.01), typically indicating neovascularization. Ultrasound effectively distinguishes PF changes in diabetes and PFis. While both conditions show PF thickening, PFis is characterised by hypoechoic hypervascular fascia, reflecting localised degeneration. Diabetic PF changes are diffuse and subclinical, without significant echo-textural disruption or inflammation. These findings underscore the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in evaluating heel pain and in the early detection of diabetic foot tissue remodelling."

We describe two cases of ODS developing in HHS with contrasting initial sodium levels: one with profound hyponatremia (Na 112 mmol\/L, corrected 167 mmol\/L) and the other with hypernatremia (Na 149 mmol\/L, corrected 177 mmol\/L). Both patients exhibited severe hyperglycemia (2,398 and 1,277 mg\/dL, respectively) and marked hyperosmolality (387 and 421 mOsm\/kg) and were managed with cautious correction rates (1.2 and 1.0 mOsm\/kg\/hour). Despite this, each patient developed ODS diagnosed by MRI on days three and seven, respectively. Neurological function gradually improved in both, with final modified Rankin Scale scores of 2 and 1, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to directly compare hyponatremic and hypernatremic ODS in the context of HHS. Severe hyperosmolality can itself trigger ODS, regardless of measured and corrected sodium levels or the rate of correction. Clinicians should maintain a low threshold for timely MRI in HHS patients with persistent or unexplained neurological deficits."

This study compared the prevalence of\u00a0neurological symptoms in individuals with T2DM with respect to the duration of disease. Methodology This cross-sectional study was carried out over a six-month period at secondary care hospitals.\u00a0A total of\u00a0420 patients\u00a0with T2DM, aged between 40 and 65 years, were categorized into three equal groups of 140 based on duration of diabetes. Group A included newly diagnosed patients (less than or equal to one year), Group B comprised individuals with one to five years of diabetes, and Group C consisted of those with a duration exceeding five years. Clinical evaluations focused on glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and postprandial glucose) and neurological complications involving peripheral, autonomic, and central nervous systems. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20 (Released 2012; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States), with chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests applied,\u00a0with\u00a0p-values <0.05 taken\u00a0as\u00a0statistically significant. Results This study's findings showed that\u00a0Group A\u00a0(less than or equal to one year) had significantly higher mean age, weight, BMI, respiratory rate, heart rate, and random blood sugar levels compared to Groups B and C. Gender distribution varied significantly, with all males in Group A and more females in Group B. Dyslipidemia and smoking history were significantly associated with diabetes duration (p < 0.001), while hypertension was not. Neuropathy symptoms, especially tingling and numbness, were more common in Group C, while autonomic symptoms like fatigue and irritability were highest in Group B. Socioeconomic status and type of therapy also showed significant differences across groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion This study concluded that peripheral neuropathy symptoms were more common in patients with longer diabetes duration, indicating progressive nerve damage over time. Some symptoms, such as burning pain and fatigue, appeared earlier, suggesting early metabolic changes. Autonomic symptoms also varied significantly, highlighting the complex progression of neurological involvement in T2DM."

        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing public health concern, particularly in India, which has a high prevalence of diabetes. While much research focuses on clinical outcomes, there is limited understanding of the lived experiences of primigravida women diagnosed with GDM. This qualitative study aimed to explore the emotional responses, self-management practices, support systems, and healthcare interactions of first-time pregnant women diagnosed with GDM. Using a phenomenological approach, 18 primigravida women with GDM attending a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, India, were recruited as a sample through purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Odia, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed with NVivo software. Six major themes emerged during the course of the study. The emotional responses included shock, anxiety, fear for the baby's health, and self-blame. Lifestyle modifications were reported as challenging, especially dietary restrictions conflicting with cultural food habits, glucose monitoring discomfort, and difficulty maintaining physical activity. Family and peer support were vital for coping, while a lack of community awareness led to stigma and isolation. Healthcare interactions varied, with clear communication and empathy fostering trust, but inconsistent advice causing confusion. Knowledge empowerment and maternal motivation enhanced self-efficacy and adaptive routines. Concerns about future diabetes risk and GDM recurrence were common, with inadequate postpartum counseling noted. Primigravida women with GDM face complex emotional, cultural, and practical challenges. Culturally tailored dietary guidance, empathetic healthcare communication, strengthened social support, and extended postpartum care are essential to improve self-management and health outcomes. Addressing these aspects holistically can enhance care quality and reduce diabetes burden in diverse settings."

Despite advances in surgical and medical care, outcomes vary widely, particularly among older patients and those with impaired cardiac function. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is commonly used to assess functional status, and age is an established predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes. Objective To evaluate whether age and NYHA functional class are independently associated with postoperative recovery and 30-day mortality among patients undergoing surgery for infective endocarditis at a tertiary care center. Methodology This retrospective cohort study included adult patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis and treated surgically at the Peshawar Institute of Cardiology between January 2022 and December 2024. Patients were classified into high-risk (age \u226565 years and\/or NYHA class III\/IV) and low-risk (age <65 years and NYHA class I\/II) groups. The primary outcome was recovery, defined as discharge without major complications, including reoperation or prolonged hospitalization beyond 14 days of surgery. The secondary outcome was 30-day mortality rate. Statistical analysis included chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression adjusted for sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Model validity was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and the area under the curve (AUC). Results Of the 260 patients, 130 (50.0%) were classified as high-risk. Recovery was significantly lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (70.0% vs. 90.0%, <i>P\u00a0<\/i>< 0.001), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 62.0-77.1 and 83.7-94.5, respectively. Thirty-day mortality was higher in the high-risk group (15.4% vs. 5.4%, <i>P\u00a0<\/i>= 0.002; 95% CI: 9.9-22.8 and 2.4-10.7, respectively). On multivariate analysis, age and NYHA class were independently associated with recovery and mortality (e.g., NYHA III\/IV: odds ratio (OR) for mortality 3.50, 95% CI: 1.50-8.17;\u00a0<i>P\u00a0<\/i>= 0.004). Conclusions Advanced age and higher NYHA class were independently associated with poorer short-term surgical outcomes in patients with infective endocarditis. These simple, routinely available variables can be integrated into preoperative assessments to improve perioperative risk stratification and guide individualized surgical planning, particularly in resource-limited settings."

        "Abstract":"Objective Diabetes mellitus is a disease that can affect various organs, and so all the symptoms should be investigated. Nonetheless, skin symptoms have received less attention than others. The duration of diabetes plays a critical role in the development and progression of systemic and dermatological complications. Existing evidence suggests that many cutaneous complications, such as diabetic dermopathy, xerosis, and infections, tend to increase in frequency and severity with longer disease duration. Therefore, this study assessed and compared the demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dermatological features of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on the duration of the disease. Methodology This cross-sectional study was performed at multiple secondary care hospitals and primary care centers. The time period of the study was from\u00a0December 1, 2024, to May 30, 2025.\u00a0This study included 290 patients with confirmed T2DM, categorized into three groups based on diabetes duration: Group A (less than one year), Group B (one to five years), and Group C (more than five years). Data were collected through clinical examination and structured questionnaires covering demographic details, lifestyle factors, treatment modalities, physiological parameters, and dermatological findings. Statistical analysis was applied using the chi-square test and a Kruskal-Wallis test, with p < 0.05 reflecting statistically significant. Results The comparison of three groups showed significant differences in gender, socioeconomic status, dyslipidemia, smoking history, and diabetes treatment. Group A had more individuals from a high socioeconomic background, while Group C had the most from the middle class. Dermatological conditions such as acanthosis nigricans (p < 0.001), callosities (p = 0.020), and bullae (p = 0.027) were significantly associated with longer diabetes duration. Conclusion This study concluded that the duration of T2DM\u00a0patients with a longer diabetes duration was linked to lower BMI, better glycemic control, and more lifestyle-based treatments, while shorter duration was associated with higher age, BMI, dyslipidemia, and smoking. Dermatological manifestations such as acanthosis nigricans, callosities, and bullae indicated a significant association with diabetes duration."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease largely fueled by insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion. Nutritional modification is a central aspect of glycemic control and the prevention of diabetes-related complications. The Dietary Approach\u00a0to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, initially designed to treat hypertension, has demonstrated encouraging evidence in enhancing metabolic control in T2DM when appropriately adapted. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a\u00a0modified DASH diet on insulin resistance and glycemic control among adults with T2DM. This quasi-experimental\u00a0non-randomized trial was conducted at Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, from May 2023 to November 2024. Sixty patients with T2DM (glycated hemoglobin or HbA1c < 7.5%) were assigned to two groups: Group A (n = 30) received counseling\u00a0on a modified DASH diet, and Group B (n = 30) was provided with a standard diabetic diet. Baseline and 12-week assessments consisted of fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile, BMI, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Dietary compliance was reinforced with regular follow-up. At baseline, the two groups were similar in age, BMI, and glycemic measures. Group A showed significantly greater decreases at 12 weeks in FBG (p = 0.001), HbA1c (within-group p < 0.001; between-group p = 0.057), and BMI (p < 0.001) compared to Group B. The reduction in HOMA-IR was also more significant in Group A, although intergroup changes at 12 weeks were significant at a borderline level but failed to meet the threshold for statistical significance. Generalized estimating equation\u00a0analysis validated notable within-group changes in Group A in weight, BMI, and glycemic parameters. The modified DASH diet demonstrated improved glycemic control, insulin resistance, and weight results at 12 weeks compared to a normal diabetic diet. These data attest to its utility as an effective dietary approach in the overall management of T2DM."

        "Abstract":"Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 (APS type 3) is defined by the coexistence of autoimmune thyroid disease with other autoimmune disorders, excluding adrenal insufficiency. It is a common but often under-recognized entity, particularly in young women with multiple autoimmune conditions. We report the case of a 27-year-old woman with a longstanding history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who presented with multiple episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis\u00a0to the emergency department. She presented with fatigue and had poor glycemic control (HbA1c 11.3%). She was further diagnosed in the ward with refractory autoimmune hypothyroidism, pernicious anemia, celiac disease with poor dietary adherence, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring retinal intervention. Physical examinations, blood workup, and radiological investigations revealed no signs of adrenal insufficiency or pituitary adenoma. The combination of autoimmune thyroid disease, T1DM, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, and systemic autoimmunity, in the absence of adrenal involvement, is consistent with a diagnosis of APS type 3 with overlapping subtypes. This case illustrates the clinical complexity and diagnostic challenges of APS type 3. Early identification and multidisciplinary management of coexisting autoimmune disorders are essential for improving long-term outcomes and reducing complications. Attention to dietary adherence, appropriate thyroid hormone dosing, and ongoing screening for evolving autoimmune involvement are critical elements in the care of such patients."

Methods A\u00a0total of 183 male patients aged 50 years and older with diagnosed lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH were included. Andropause symptoms were evaluated using the Male Andropause Symptoms Self-Assessment Questionnaire (MASSQ), while testosterone levels were measured using a\u00a0chemiluminescent immunoassay. LUTS severity was assessed through the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and erectile function via the International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-15). However, the cross-sectional design and it being conducted in a single center limit the study. Results The mean andropause symptom score was 57.24 \u00b1 12.62, indicating moderate to severe symptoms. A significant correlation was observed between increasing lower urinary tract symptom\u00a0(LUTS) severity and higher andropause symptom scores (p < 0.001). Testosterone levels were significantly lower in patients with severe LUTS (285.94 \u00b1 106.9 ng\/dL) compared to those with mild LUTS (544.09 \u00b1 109.8 ng\/dL). Additionally, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased severity of both LUTS and erectile dysfunction (ED). Conclusions The study highlights a significant prevalence of andropause symptoms in men with BPH, emphasizing the correlation between declining testosterone levels and LUTS severity. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive assessments and management strategies that address both hormonal deficiencies and urinary health in older men."

This study aimed to investigate the correlation of the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-BMI index, and TG\/HDL ratio with glycemic control. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2023 to February 2024 at the Jericho Health Center, Palestine. A total of 240 T2DM patients were categorized into two groups based on glycemic control: good (HbA1c <7) and poor (HbA1c \u22657). Spearman correlation was used to assess the associations, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate\u00a0the predictive performance of the indices. Results Of 240 patients, 39% had good and 61% had poor glycemic control. The TyG and TyG-BMI indices were significantly higher (P<0.001) in those with poor glycemic control (5.0 vs. 4.8; 155 vs. 142, respectively). The TyG index cutoff was 4.8 (81% sensitivity, 55% specificity; AUC=0.744, p<0.001)\u00a0while the TyG-BMI index cutoff was 162 (43.2% sensitivity, 76.3% specificity; AUC=0.591, p=0.018). The TyG index correlated positively with fasting plasma glucose (r=0.687), HbA1c (r=0.464), triglycerides (r=0.740), and cholesterol (r=0.254), and negatively with HDL-C (r=-0.200; all p<0.01). TyG-BMI correlated strongly with BMI (r=0.939)\u00a0and weakly but significantly with systolic (r=0.204) and diastolic blood pressure (r=0.146). No significant correlation was found between TG\/HDL and glycemic control. Conclusion Compared to TyG-BMI, the TyG index showed better diagnostic accuracy and stronger associations with metabolic markers, suggesting it may serve as a cost-effective and practical marker for evaluating glycemic control in T2DM patients. The low area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity of TyG-BMI might limit its usefulness in this context. Establishing a population-specific cutoff based on inexpensive and routine laboratory measures enhances its practical utility in clinical settings."

The major risk factor for cognitive dysfunction is diabetes mellitus. The middle-aged population is the main breadwinners of the family, yet the most neglected when it comes to health. With our study, we evaluated the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction among middle-aged patients with diabetes mellitus and identified the risk factors associated with it. Subjects and methods We conducted a study involving 329 middle-aged patients (aged 40-69) with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending the outpatient department (OPD) of community and family medicine (CFM), general medicine, and endocrinology\u00a0at a medical college located in the southern region of India. We assessed cognitive dysfunction in these patients using a standardized cognitive screening tool. Then, an interview schedule was taken, which contained information on sociodemographic variables and anthropometry. Recent reports of investigations, viz., fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) values, and body mass index (BMI) were also recorded. Institutional ethics committee approval was obtained prior to the start of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Results The mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of the participants was found to be 51 \u00b1 5.6 years. Among the 329 middle-aged\u00a0participants with\u00a0type 2 diabetes mellitus, there were 162 male participants (49.24%) and 167 female participants (50.76%). The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction among middle-aged patients with\u00a0type 2 diabetes mellitus in the current study was 48.6%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 43.2%-54%. In contrast, higher years of completed education, better socioeconomic status class, and receiving two or more doses of COVID-19 vaccines were associated with lower odds of cognitive dysfunction, indicating a protective effect. Conclusions It is crucial for India to prioritize cognitive health, invest in research and education, and develop comprehensive strategies to address this growing issue among the middle-aged diabetic population. Focused efforts of prevention, screening, and managing cognitive impairment should be started."

The clinical data of patients who underwent gastric ESD at our center from 2009 to 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Pain severity was assessed using a visual analogue scale, with a score \u2265\u20094 defined as postoperative pain. Based on the presence or absence of postoperative pain, patients were divided into a pain group and a control group. Independent factors influencing postoperative pain were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. To control for confounding bias, patients in the case and control groups were matched by sex and lesion size, and the matched participants were further analyzed using a conditional logistic regression model. In total, 993 patients were analyzed. The incidence of postoperative pain was 9.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3-11.1). In the univariate analysis, sex, operation duration, anesthesia method, intraoperative electrocoagulation, nasogastric tube placement, and postoperative vomiting were significantly associated with postoperative pain. Multivariate analysis identified eight independent factors: male sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-0.97; <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.04), operation duration (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63; <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.02), protuberant lesions (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.71; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.01), antral lesions (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.10-3.05; <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.01), intubation general anesthesia (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.72; <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.002), intraoperative electrocoagulation (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.19-0.55; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.01), nasogastric tube placement (OR, 2.005; 95% CI, 1.12-3.57; <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.01), and postoperative vomiting (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.40-7.47; <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.005).

While prior research on the pathophysiology of diabetic gastroenteropathy (DGE) focused primarily on autonomic neuropathy, particularly involving the vagus nerve, recent studies have shifted toward the impairment of the enteric nervous system (ENS). As the largest autonomous neural network governing GI motility independent of central control, structural and functional abnormalities of the ENS constitute the fundamental pathological basis for DGE. This review first delineates gut microbial alterations in diabetes and mechanisms by which dysbiosis compromises the integrity of the ENS. Second, we analyze how microbiota-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, tryptophan), gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1, ghrelin), and neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide) multitarget the ENS-collectively establishing the \"microbiota-ENS axis\" as the central hub for GI sensorimotor control. Finally, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical evidence for microbiome-targeted therapies (probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation) in alleviating DGE symptoms and repairing ENS while outlining translational challenges and future research priorities."

        "Abstract":"Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) causes high rates of amputation and mortality. To compare incidence, management and prognosis in hospitalised patients with CLTI with and without diabetes mellitus (DM) in 2001 and 2023. A secondary objective was to compare adherence to global vascular guidelines on risk factors between patients with and without DM in 2023. Retrospective study. Group differences were tested using the Mann-Whitney <i>U<\/i> test, independent sample <i>t<\/i> test or the Chi-square test, as appropriate. The effects of DM on major amputation or mortality at 1\u2009year were evaluated in a multivariable logistic regression model according to a directed acyclic graph. The incidence of hospitalisations for CLTI was reduced from 37.4 (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.3-41.6) in 2001 to 22.8 (95% CI, 19.7-25.8) per 100,000\u2009person-years in 2023. The proportion of patients on full-dose oral anticoagulant therapy (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and lipid-lowering treatment (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001) increased significantly between the two time periods. In 2023, Wounds, Ischemia and foot Infection-classification in all patients with foot ulcers was documented in 6.9%. Anaemia was present at hospital admission in 67.0% and 52.5% of patients with CLTI with and without DM, respectively (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.031). Endovascular therapy was performed more often in those with DM compared to those without DM (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.004). Antiplatelet therapy (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.008) and smoking cessation interventions (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.033) were offered less often to those with DM. DM (odds ratio (OR), 1.7 (95% CI, 1.02-2.83)) was independently associated with increased mortality at 1\u2009year, whereas period 2023 as opposed to 2001 (OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.38-0.99)) was associated with decreased mortality. The incidence of hospitalisation for CLTI appears to have been reduced, and medical care of patients with CLTI has improved prognosis. Nevertheless, there is still room for large improvements of secondary prevention care in patients with CLTI, particularly in those with DM."

        "Abstract":"Mucormycosis is a severe invasive infection caused by the Mucorales fungi. The most frequently implicated genera are <i>Rhizopus<\/i> species, <i>Mucor<\/i> species, and <i>Lichtheimia<\/i> species. These fungi do not typically cause infections in immunocompetent individuals. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, malignancies, transplant recipients, and current or past COVID-19 infection. Mucorales have also been linked to outbreaks in healthcare settings and following natural disasters. We describe a case of rapidly progressing rhinosinusitis in a patient with advanced HIV infection due to <i>Saksenaea oblongispora<\/i>, a rare cause of mucormycosis that, in contrast to the other Mucorales, primarily affects immunocompetent hosts following traumatic inoculation. A 32-year-old male patient presented with right-sided facial swelling. His clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. Biopsies and computerized tomography (CT) of the brain and sinuses were performed. Tuberculosis and bacterial workups were negative. Histological examination showed thick-walled angioinvasive fungal elements. Fungal cultures were positive. Molecular testing identified the organism as <i>S. oblongispora<\/i>. Due to his rapid deterioration, he neither underwent surgical intervention nor received any antifungal therapy and subsequently demised. This is the first case of <i>S. oblongispora<\/i> infection described in sub-Saharan Africa and in the setting of HIV. Infection by this fungus accounts for approximately 3% of human mucormycosis cases. <i>S. oblongispora<\/i>-associated rhinosinusitis is extremely uncommon and has been associated with rapid progression with high morbidity and mortality. A combination of different testing platforms was required to make a diagnosis. This case emphasizes the challenge of diagnosing invasive mold infections timeously. A high index of suspicion, combined with a multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment approach, is essential for the management of these infections."

        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 5.8% to 25.1% of pregnant women and is associated with a range of adverse perinatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity, neonatal respiratory distress, and adiposity. Offspring of mothers with GDM or diabetes mellitus (DM) are also at elevated risk for long-term metabolic complications, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and type 2 DM. While systemic and structural anomalies-including congenital heart disease, skeletal malformations, and renal agenesis-have been well documented, limited attention has been paid to ophthalmic consequences. Accordingly, this study aims to summarize current evidence on the impact of maternal GDM\/DM on the ocular development and long-term visual outcomes in offspring. A review was conducted, integrating findings from studies describing ocular abnormalities in offspring born to mothers with GDM\/DM. GDM\/DM during pregnancy may contribute to a spectrum of ocular anomalies in offspring, including hypoplasia of the iris stroma, vascular tortuosity and dilation of the iris vessels, optic nerve hypoplasia, decreased macular thickness and volume, and an increased risk of long-term ophthalmic morbidity such as refractive errors. Given the range of potential ophthalmic abnormalities in offspring of mothers with GDM\/DM, regular ocular screening and long-term follow-up are recommended. Further research is warranted to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop evidence-based screening protocols."

Diabetes self-management education and support facilitate learning of necessary knowledge and skills, by incorporating patient needs and evidence-based standards to improve outcomes. However, adherence to self-management is challenging because of insufficient education. This study assessed self-care management, a standard of care for patients with diabetes mellitus, in Jeddah, KSA. This cross-sectional study examined self-care practices among patients with diabetes at a tertiary center in Jeddah, KSA. Data were gathered through an online survey conducted from December 2023 to April 2024. Participants included patients 18 years or older with diabetes at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. Healthcare workers and patients without diabetes were excluded. We collected information on demographics; disease duration; medications; adherence; complications; and knowledge and education regarding diabetes management. A revised version of the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire was used to explore self-care activities in diabetes management. Statistical analysis with the chi-squared test for qualitative variables, Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative non-parametric variables, and Spearman's test for correlation was performed in SPSS 26. <i>P<\/i> < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Knowledge regarding hyperglycemia management was adequate in 70 % of participants, but only 45 % were aware of how to adjust medications during illnesses. Physical activity levels were low, and 60 % of participants reported minimal exercise. Participants receiving intensive insulin, compared with those not receiving this therapy, showed a stronger correlation between knowledge and self-care practices (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.18; <i>P<\/i> = 0.002). Having more frequent interactions with healthcare providers was associated with higher self-management scores. Patients with diabetes in KSA had moderate knowledge yet showed knowledge gaps in illness management.

        "Abstract":"This study explores the predictive utility of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in assessing outcomes for patients with chronic left heart failure (LHF). A cohort of 59 patients diagnosed with chronic LHF was compared to 59 healthy controls. BNP levels, alongside other cardiac function parameters, such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), were evaluated. Results revealed that BNP levels were positively correlated with worsening cardiac function and negatively correlated with LVEF. In individuals with obesity or Type 2 diabetes mellitus, BNP levels were unexpectedly lower, whereas patients with chronic kidney disease or atrial fibrillation exhibited elevated BNP levels. A BNP cut-off value of 98.9 was identified, demonstrating high diagnostic sensitivity (91.53%), specificity (83.05%), and accuracy (88.14%). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicated strong diagnostic performance for BNP in predicting adverse cardiovascular events. The findings underscore BNP's value not only as a biomarker for diagnosing LHF but also in prognostication and tailoring patient-specific interventions. Future studies should validate these findings across diverse populations to enhance clinical application. <b>Trial Registration:<\/b> Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR2500101966."

Moreover, tobacco use interferes with glycaemic control, and there is a proven link between smoking and diabetes complications. This cross-sectional study investigates the prevalence of tobacco use and the effect of advice about quitting and its impact at one-month and one-year follow-ups in outpatient type 2 diabetics. Type 2 diabetes patients attending physician OPD in tertiary care hospitals were interviewed using a questionnaire based on Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2, India. They also received the National Toll-Free Quitline Number 1800112356 and the M Cessation no. 011-22901701. The free tobacco cessation clinic details at the government hospital in Pune were also shared, in case patients wanted to attend these facilities. The prevalence of tobacco use was 19% (present and former tobacco usage), wherein smoking contributed 9.0%, smokeless tobacco (SLT) contributed 7.5%, and dual use contributed 2.5%. The highest use was observed in the seventh decade. More women than men used smokeless tobacco. Poly SLT use and dual tobacco use - smoking and smokeless tobacco products, use of areca nut with SLT was also observed. Following brief physician advice, 27.2% quit tobacco usage at one-year follow-up. A history of tobacco use needs to be asked to all type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in each visit, documenting it, explaining the importance of quitting tobacco in the context of diabetes, and advising to quit tobacco, even to elderly patients. If all the physicians in the health system offer quit advice to all the tobacco users, many patients are likely to quit tobacco."

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can affect adults' sleep quality, and prenatal phenol exposure impacts fetal development. To assess associations between prenatal phenol concentrations and child sleep outcomes. We used data from the National Institutes of Health-funded Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u20091,198) that were collected from 2008 to 2019 at several sites across the United States. The present analysis was conducted in 2023-2024. Using single-pollutant and mixture models, we examined associations between prenatal phenol concentrations and three key child sleep quality outcomes: sleep problems, disturbance, and impairment. Child sleep outcomes were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment scales. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models were examined, with stratified models and interaction terms used to examine interactions with child sex. Of the eight phenols assessed, higher prenatal methylparaben concentrations were associated with lower child sleep-related impairment scores (<i>\u03b2<\/i>\u2009=\u2009-4.79, 95% CI: -9.45 to -0.14).

        "Abstract":"Patients with metabolic syndrome and coronary artery disease (CAD) are at increased risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which can progress to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. MASLD is the most common liver disease and a significant contributor to cardiovascular morbidity. Enhanced platelet aggregation is linked to steatohepatitis, and antiplatelet therapy has been suggested as a potential treatment. In a prospective study of 51 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and\/or obesity (BMI\u226530), we evaluated the impact of antiplatelet therapy on hepatic fat content, liver volume, and iron deposition using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and six months. Ex vivo platelet function testing and plasma levels of proinflammatory chemotactic cytokines were measured to characterize thromboinflammatory mechanisms underlying MASLD. Increased platelet reactivity correlated with greater hepatic fat, iron deposition, and liver volume. Antiplatelet therapy was associated with reductions in hepatic volume and iron accumulation. Progression of steatosis was linked to dyslipidemia, platelet hyperreactivity, and elevated plasma levels of profibrotic, inflammatory, and apoptotic chemokines\/cytokines. A distinct systemic cytokine profile corresponded with morphological features of progressive MASLD. Reduced platelet aggregation is associated with attenuation of MASLD features. Antiplatelet therapy correlates with decreased pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic chemokine signaling linked to the morphological characteristics of MASLD. Assessment of platelet reactivity and specific chemokines may enhance understanding of MASLD pathophysiology and support the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

However, there is a lack of data on the association between NHR and the incidence of diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the potential value of NHR as a predictor of incident diabetes among Chinese adults. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 16658 participants who had received annual health checkups at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from 2017 to 2024. The participants were split into four groups (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) based on NHR levels. The cumulative diabetes incidence was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves, compared using the Log rank test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to calculate the optimal cut-off point of NHR for predicting diabetes risk. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to explore the association of the NHR and diabetes incidence. A total of 12869 subjects were enrolled. The median follow\u2011up period was 5.1 years. An incrementally higher NHR was associated with an increasingly higher cumulative incidence of diabetes (Log rank test, p < 0.001). Compared to Q1, the fully adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of the Q2, Q3, and Q4 groups for new\u2011onset diabetes were 1.43 (0.81-2.53), 1.77 (1.03-3.06), and 2.80 (1.64-4.79), respectively. The AUCs obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were 0.669 (95% CI: 0.63-0.70, p<0.001) for NHR. Based on the highest Youden's index, the optimal threshold was 3.25 for NHR. In addition, there were interactions between NHR and age (\u226540), and adverse emotions (anxiety or depression) in subgroup analyses. The NHR was significantly associated with the incidence of diabetes, suggesting that the NHR may be a valid marker for risk stratification for T2DM."

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive estimate of the prevalence of prediabetes among Saudi adults. We searched databases for cross-sectional studies conducted between January 2000 and September 2024. We included studies written in English and conducted in Saudi Arabia. The studies had to report the prevalence of prediabetes among adults (\u226518 years) using American Diabetes Association (ADA) or the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. We excluded studies that involved non-adult or non-Saudi populations. We also excluded studies published before 2000 or those without clear diagnostic criteria or prevalence data. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement guidelines. Pooled prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies. We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 4.0 to perform the statistical calculations. Eighteen cross-sectional studies were analyzed, including 47,718 adult Saudis from the general population. The pooled national prevalence of prediabetes among Saudi adults was estimated at 24.1% (95% CI [19.5%-29.4%]). Sensitivity analysis confirmed this pooled prevalence. Funnel plot inspection and Egger's test indicated no substantial publication bias.

Meta-regression analysis indicated a slight upward trend in prevalence over time, with a positive coefficient for 'Year' (0.027). A high pooled prevalence of prediabetes was documented among the adult Saudi population, with a markedly higher prevalence among males. These findings emphasize the need for early lifestyle interventions, optimized screening programs, and effective resource allocation to prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes. We acknowledge the high level of heterogeneity among the included studies. Additionally, we note that no eligible studies specifically from the northern region of Saudi Arabia were included in the meta-analysis."

Exercise is more effective in improving MDA, an indicator of oxidative stress, when the intervention method is aerobic exercise, the period is >12 weeks and the frequency is <5 days\/week, which improves oxidative stress indicators SOD. This study included 11 articles with an average PEDro score of 6.5, indicating good quality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses of the oxidative stress indicators MDA and SOD failed to identify sources of heterogeneity, which is a limitation. Publication bias tests for the oxidative stress indicators MDA and SOD suggest that there is no significant publication bias. Therefore, moderate-quality evidence is given to the oxidative stress indicator MDA, and high-quality evidence is given to the oxidative stress indicator SOD. Exercise has a significant effect on improving oxidative stress indicators MDA and SOD in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is affected by the patient's age, the method, duration, and frequency of the intervention. It can provide evidence-based medical evidence for the clinical rehabilitation of patients with type 2 diabetes."

The baseline population included 258 female participants (37.2%), with longitudinal data collected over a 4.5-year follow-up period conducted between March 2013 and January 2025. DKD was diagnosed per the 2024 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes. Disease severity stratification employed two validated biomarkers: urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) and eGFR calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. <b>Results:<\/b> The analytical cohort comprised 421 participants in the urinary AER group and 487 in the eGFR group. Baseline albuminuria stratification revealed 61.3% normoalbuminuria, 36.6% microalbuminuria, and 2.4% macroalbuminuria. Over 4.5 years of follow-up, 9.9% demonstrated albuminuria stage progression. The prevalence of G1, G2, G3, and G4 was 51.4%, 37.7%, 10.5%, and 0.5%, respectively, with 32.5% exhibiting renal function deterioration. Albuminuria progression correlated with smoking, alcohol consumption, elevated baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and increasing waist circumference, while eGFR decline associated with male sex, advanced age, prolonged diabetes duration, and elevated baseline urinary AER. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> Longitudinal analysis of T2DM patients revealed an escalation in the prevalence of micro- or macroalbuminuria and renal dysfunction. Disease progression predominated over regression across the cohort. Key modifiable risk factors associated with DKD progression included tobacco use, alcohol intake, elevated baseline TSH, increasing waist circumference, male sex, age, prolonged diabetes duration, and elevated baseline urinary AER."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a globally concerning chronic disease. Fear of complications (FoC) refers to a unique diabetes-related emotion among diabetic patients, arising from worries that complications may cause physical harm, which can affect blood glucose control. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the factors influencing FoC and implement effective intervention plans. To understand the real experiences of patients with T2DM when facing the FoC, so as to provide a reference for implementing targeted nursing intervention measures to alleviate the patients' psychological FoC. Using the purposive sampling method, 16 patients with T2DM were selected as the research subjects from the Department of Endocrinology of a Class III Grade A hospital in Shaanxi Province from March to April 2025. A phenomenological research method was adopted to conduct semi-structured interviews with them. The Colaizzi's seven-step analysis method was used to analyze the data and extract themes. A total of 3 themes and 9 sub-themes were extracted, including disease uncertainty (uncertainty in symptoms, uncertainty in management, uncertainty caused by medical staff sources, uncertainty caused by personal sources), social support (peer support, medical support, family support), and coping styles (acceptance and facing, evasion and submission). The experience of FoC among patients with T2DM is complex and diverse. Medical staff should attach great importance to providing psychological counseling for these patients, eliminating their sense of uncertainty about the disease, offering professional guidance, and assisting in achieving multi-faceted support. This can help alleviate their experience of FoC and thus promote their physical and mental health."

An 80-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus was transferred to an Australian quaternary hospital with refractory hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis despite receiving >300 units of insulin daily. Laboratory testing revealed a very high insulin antibody titer of 6758\u2005U\/mL (6758 kU\/L)(<0.4 U\/mL; <0.4\u2005kU\/L). Plasmapheresis was considered but was not pursued because of hemodynamic instability, multiple comorbidities and frailty. Treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone at 1\u2005mg\/kg for 5 days and 500\u2005mg of mycophenolate mofetil twice daily, followed by a tapering regimen of prednisone, resulted in a significant improvement in extreme insulin resistance.

The aim of this study is to evaluate through meta-analysis the impact of nurse-led DSME on glycemic control, lipid profiles, and self-efficacy in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases (up to February 28, 2025). Inclusion criteria comprised: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nurse-led DSME (\u22653 structured sessions) vs. usual care or other non-nurse-led interventions. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0. Effect sizes [mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD)] were pooled using R meta package with random-effects models (<i>I<\/i> <sup>2<\/sup> > 50%). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed. Eight RCTs (reporting HbA1c outcomes) were included. Meta-analysis demonstrated: (1) Glycemic control: nurse-led DSME significantly reduced HbA1c at 4-6 months (MD = -0.92, 95% CI: -1.44 to -0.41) and >6 months (MD = -0.54, 95% CI: -0.86 to -0.23; <i>p<\/i> < 0.05), but not at 0-3 months (MD = -0.22, 95% CI: -1.15 to 0.51).

(2) Self-efficacy: the intervention group demonstrated significantly enhanced self-efficacy (SMD = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.04-1.92). (3) Lipid profiles: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased significantly (MD = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.14-0.41), while total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) showed no significant changes. (4) Considerable heterogeneity was observed (HbA1c: <i>I<\/i> <sup>2<\/sup> = 87.8%; self-efficacy: <i>I<\/i> <sup>2<\/sup> = 84.5%). Meta-regression suggested borderline significant influence of follow-up duration on effect size (<i>p<\/i> = 0.059). No significant publication bias was detected (Egger's test <i>p<\/i> = 0.116). Nurse-led DSME effectively improves long-term glycemic control and self-efficacy while elevating HDL levels in T2DM patients, though standardization of intervention protocols is needed to reduce heterogeneity.

While previous studies have established a positive association between depression and the risk of sarcopenia, the underlying mechanisms driving this relationship remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between depression and sarcopenia risk in older adults with diabetes, with a particular focus on the potential mediating roles of nutrition and physical activity. The findings would provide empirical evidence to inform future prevention and intervention strategies. A multi-center cross-sectional study. A total of 312 older adult patients with diabetes were selected from two hospitals using a convenience sampling method. The study evaluated demographic and clinical characteristics, along with factors such as nutrition, physical activity, depression, and sarcopenia risk. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the association between depression and sarcopenia risk. Furthermore, the bootstrap resampling method, involving 5,000 samples and a 95% confidence interval (CI), was employed to examine the parallel mediating effects and determine whether nutrition and physical activity mediated the relationship between depression and sarcopenia risk. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 26.0 and Mplus 7.0 software. A total of 58.0% of participants were found to be at high risk for sarcopenia. Depression was shown to influence sarcopenia risk significantly, with nutrition and physical activity acting as parallel mediators. The total indirect effect was estimated at 0.087 (95% CI: 0.056, 0.126), accounting for 34.9% of the total effect (total effect\u202f=\u202f0.249, 95% CI: 0.175, 0.311). Notably, nutrition played a crucial role in this mediation, contributing 61% of the total indirect effect. A significant proportion of older adults with diabetes were found to be at high risk of sarcopenia, which underscores the importance of routine screening for sarcopenia risk in older adults with diabetes. Depression was strongly associated with sarcopenia risk, with nutrition and physical activity acting as parallel mediators in this relationship. Given the pivotal role of nutrition in this parallel mediation model, the implementation of individualized nutrition plans is crucial for preventing muscle loss and reducing the risk of sarcopenia."

We explored the metabolic regulatory pathways and mechanisms of BJRD in Type 1 DM (T1DM). <b>Methods:<\/b> T1DM rat model was established with STZ induction and then continuously treated with insulin and different concentrations of BJRD for 2\u2009weeks. The therapeutic effect of BJRD was evaluated by detecting the levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin in the blood and observing the ultrastructure of pancreatic tissues by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescent staining. Metabolomics analysis on rat serum was performed. <b>Results:<\/b> Compared with the diabetes model (DC) group, the high-concentration BJRD treatment (BJRD-H) group reduced fasting blood glucose, increased insulin levels, and increased the quantity of \u03b2-cells in the pancreatic tissues in rats. And rat pancreatic islet \u03b2-cells in the DC group had lost their nuclear membranes, had abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and had significantly reduced secretory granules, whereas rat pancreatic islet \u03b2-cells in the BJRD-H group had moderately increased secretory granules, and the structure of the nucleus was apparently normal. Moreover, the metabolic profile expression pattern of rats in the BJRD-H group was closer to that of normal rats, suggesting that a high concentration of BJRD combined with insulin treatment was more effective. And differentially expressed metabolites were predominantly enriched in amino acid metabolism, including amino acids, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> BJRD facilitated the therapeutic effect of insulin in T1DM rats and resulted in a significant improvement in their metabolic profiles, expanding the application of traditional Chinese medicine's alternative therapies in T1DM."

Therefore, developing drugs with the potential to alter disease progression has been a priority. This study aims to review the efficacy and safety of drugs for AD. Based on the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) document, a systematic review was carried out in different databases. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) was used as the primary outcome. The risk of bias was checked using the Risk of Bias in Randomized Trials (RoB 2). A systematic review resulted in 64 articles which were included in the analysis. The main medications discussed were: donepezil, which demonstrated a significant improvement in cognitive function, with good tolerability, although it has limitations in patients with swallowing difficulties. Transdermal patches showed similar effectiveness and were recently approved. Galantamine showed benefits on cognitive function, with good tolerability. Rivastigmine was effective and presented in transdermal form with similar efficacy to capsules, but had mainly gastrointestinal adverse effects. Pioglitazone showed no significant results initially, but some studies suggest benefits in patients with AD associated with type II diabetes mellitus. The studies reviewed indicate that, although some current medications such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine have modest, well-established benefits in clinical practice, many new agents have not yet demonstrated significant efficacy in modifying AD progression."

Many SIDS' health facilities are in high-risk areas such as coastal zones and are affected by extreme weather events. It is imperative to develop climate-resilient health systems to ensure health service continuity during and after an extreme weather event. One model to achieve this is the Smart Hospital Initiative. <i>Objective:<\/i> This case study was designed to strengthen the evidence base for decision-making regarding investing in Smart Hospital Initiative facilities as a climate adaptation strategy. <i>Methods:<\/i> This case study used secondary data derived from the Smart Hospital Initiative implementation (<i>n<\/i> = 55) focusing on four domains: country population\/population served by the facility; pre-post Smart Hospital Initiative facilities' data; disaster and severe weather events' data; and diabetes mellitus (DM) mortality data. To assess the effectiveness of the initiative, an analysis of these data domains across seven countries is presented. <i>Findings:<\/i> Examining population size and healthcare service resources, healthcare facilities' readiness, climate-related disasters, and a health condition of concern, represents a viable strategy to assess the impact of climate adaptation on health. The Hospital Safety Index data showed that there were statistically significant pre-post retrofitted smart improvements across all 55 retrofitted facilities. The findings revealed that the effectiveness of any adaptation strategy is influenced by local financial and human resources beyond an initial, often external, investment and the capability to maintain the initial retrofitting of health facilities' impact on DM mortality. <i>Conclusions:<\/i> Climate-smart hospitals are a promising initiative to support the development of climate-resilient health facilities in SIDS. However, successful implementation depends on local capacity to support implementation and maintenance.

Here, we performed daily sampling over a 14-day observational period under the habitual diet, followed by a 14-day dietary fiber intervention in overweight participants with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. By combining daily sampling, guild-level approach, and time-series analysis, we revealed diverse temporal response patterns among various microbiota members that are often missed by conventional sampling. These patterns were closely linked to their genetic capacities for carbohydrate utilization and transport. Moreover, time-delayed analysis of longitudinal multi-omics data identified specific metabolites that potentially mediate the beneficial effects of gut microbiota on host metabolism. Overall, our findings demonstrate the necessity of high-frequency sampling for capturing dynamic microbial responses and offer reliable targets for mechanistic investigations."

These data highlight the need for early identification and intervention for BBD in T1D. Proactive measures, such as routine screening and comprehensive T1D management with strict attention to glycemic control, are crucial to address the significant burden of BBD and improve overall health outcomes for children with T1D and their families."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with reduced cardiopulmonary function, decreased aerobic capacity, and increased respiratory complications. Effective non-pharmacological interventions are essential to improve exercise tolerance and overall health in diabetic individuals. To evaluate the effectiveness of intercostal stretching techniques combined with aerobic dance exercises on VO\u2082 max and chest tightness in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 30 male participants, aged 30-50 years, with T2DM were enrolled in a 12-week intervention involving intercostal stretching and aerobic dance exercises for 60 minutes, -three to five days per week. Pre- and post-intervention assessments of VO\u2082 max (mL\/kg\/min) and chest tightness (modified Borg dyspnea scale) were performed using spirometry and standardized scales. Paired <i>t<\/i>-tests were conducted to analyze the differences. Post-intervention analysis revealed a significant increase in VO\u2082 max (mean difference = 13.4 \u00b1 5.577, <i>t<\/i> = 13.159, <i>P<\/i> < 0.001) and a significant reduction in chest tightness scores (mean difference = 2.233 \u00b1 1.524, <i>t<\/i> = 8.025, <i>P<\/i> < 0.001). These improvements were statistically highly significant compared to the critical <i>t<\/i>-value (2.15) at 29 degrees of freedom. The combination of intercostal stretching and aerobic dance significantly enhanced cardiopulmonary function, increased VO\u2082 max, and reduced respiratory discomfort in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings support the integration of such exercise protocols into diabetes management programs to improve functional capacity and quality of life."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common initial presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children occurring in up to 40% of cases. DKA can also be associated with severe complications, including nephrolithiasis. We present the case of a 12\u2009years and 8-month-old boy who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to bilateral urinary lithiasis during the onset of T1DM with DKA. After conventional treatment for DKA, laboratory tests showed increased creatinine and azotemia. 24\u2009hours later, he developed lumbar pain and anuria. Plain radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral renal calculi and pelvic dilation. An urgent bilateral ascending pyelography with stent placement was performed. Right ureteral stenting was successful, but left stenting failed due to an intramural ureteral anatomical variant; thus, a nephrostomy was performed. Diuresis resumed immediately, and renal function normalized over the following days without permanent impairment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of bilateral lithiasis with ureteral stenosis in a pediatric patient with DKA. In patients with severe DKA, we recommend routine monitoring of kidney function with a low threshold for CT imaging whenever there is an unexpected rise in creatinine, oliguria\/anuria, or lumbar pain. Early multidisciplinary intervention can promptly relieve postrenal obstruction, prevent permanent renal damage, and improve outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Glucose measurement is a critical investigation in metabolic disease management, especially in diabetes and inherited disorders. However, both laboratory-based and handheld point-of-care (HPOC) (glucometers) glucose testing face significant preanalytical and analytical challenges. In central laboratories, glycolysis in uncentrifuged samples leads to glucose consumption, which may compromise diagnostic accuracy. Although sodium fluoride (NaF) is commonly used as a glycolysis inhibitor, it has a delayed effect, requiring several hours to stabilize glucose concentrations. Recently, citrate-buffered NaF-EDTA (FCE) tubes have been introduced to inhibit glycolysis more effectively, yet they remain underused. Preanalytical variables, including sample collection, transport, and processing delays, further impact glucose stability and the diagnosis of diabetes, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). HPOC devices provide an alternative by delivering rapid results and minimizing preanalytical errors, but glucose meters are prone to physiological and analytical interferences, such as hematocrit variations, environmental conditions, presence of redox-active drugs, and enzymatic specificity issues. These interferences may lead to inaccurate glucose readings, impairing clinical decision-making, especially in intensive care and emergency settings. Moreover, discrepancies between capillary and venous glucose concentrations can contribute to misdiagnosis and inappropriate glycemic management. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of glucose measurement methodologies, their limitations, and potential improvements, emphasizing the need for preanalytical harmonization in laboratory testing and a better understanding of interferences in HPOC testing. Standardization of blood sample handling and adoption of optimized collection tubes could enhance glucose measurement reliability, ultimately improving diabetes diagnosis and patient outcomes."

This cross-sectional study included individuals aged 18\u2009years or older, diagnosed with DM. The Chrononutrition Profile Questionnaire was used to assess sleep and chrononutrition preferences and patterns on weekdays, weekends, and weekly. Weekly and weekday misalignments were calculated and presented using histograms. Differences between weekday and weekend patterns (social jetlag) were analysed using paired t-test for symmetrical variables, and the Wilcoxon test for asymmetric variables. In total, 365 individuals were studied. No significant weekly and weekday misalignments in sleep and chrononutrition were found. However, social jetlag was observed. Wake time, first eating event, eating midpoint, and sleep midpoint occurred earlier on weekdays. Lunch latency and eating window were shorter on weekends, and sleep duration was shorter on weekdays. Participants also went to sleep later on the weekends and had a longer morning latency (interval between wake-up and first eating event) on weekdays. In conclusion, interesting social jetlag was identified. These findings are relevant for understanding how sleep and chrononutrition patterns may influence the development or worsening of DM-related complications."

        "Title":"Diabetes Mellitus and Infectious Diseases: Current Evidence and Clinical Implications.",
        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus predisposes individuals to a broad spectrum of infections. People with diabetes face a 1.5- to 4-fold increased risk of both common and severe infections, and infections remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Chronic hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and complement activation, while vascular insufficiency and neuropathy compromise tissue perfusion and barrier integrity. These defects, together with altered skin, mucosal, and gut microbiota, influence the marked susceptibility to urinary tract infections (especially renal abscess and emphysematous pyelonephritis), osteomyelitis, diabetic foot infections, pneumonia (including influenza), tuberculosis, skin and soft tissue infections, and lifethreatening syndromes such as emphysematous cholecystitis and rhino-orbital mucormycosis that are almost exclusive to people with diabetes. Outcomes from infections are worse in diabetes. Although the core therapeutic principles align with those for patients without diabetes, management should be individualized. Glycemic control should balance infection risk and hypoglycemia; antimicrobial dosing should account for renal function and drug interactions; and strict antimicrobial stewardship is required. If needed, prompt debridement and multidisciplinary intervention are necessary to mitigate complications and reduce mortality. Preventive care relies on comprehensive vaccination (influenza, pneumococcus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], hepatitis B, herpes zoster, and Tdap\/Td) and regular foot surveillance with offloading to avert ulceration."

We used the TriNetX US collaborative network to identify 3\u2009165\u2009521 patients with T2DM from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2022. Of these, we selected 69\u2009874, 109\u2009922 and 88\u2009079 matched pairs of GLP-1 RA and basal insulin users, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) users, respectively, based on propensity scores. We used the Cox proportional hazards models and subgroup analyses to determine the relative hazards of IBD development and medical utilisation between the study and control groups. In the matched cohorts, GLP-1 RA users had a significantly lower risk of developing IBD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.725, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.564-0.931) and hospitalisation (HR: 0.144, 95% CI: 0.140-0.148) than basal insulin users. GLP-1 RA users also had a significantly lower risk of developing IBD (HR: 0.814, 95% CI: 0.686-0.966) and hospitalisation (HR: 0.660, 95% CI: 0.647-0.672) than the matched DPP-4i users. GLP-1 RA users had a significantly lower risk of hospitalisation (HR: 0.792, 95% CI: 0.775-0.809) than the matched SGLT2i users. Among patients with T2DM, GLP-1 RA users demonstrated a significantly lower risk of developing IBD than basal insulin and DPP-4i users. GLP-1 RA users also showed a lower risk of hospitalisation. GLP-1 RAs may contribute to lowering the risk of IBD in individuals with T2DM."

        "Abstract":"Previous studies suggested adjusting insulin doses during hemodialysis to reduce intra- and post-hemodialysis hypoglycemia. However, the impact of insulin adjustment on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains unclear. Although reducing hypoglycemia is a well-documented benefit of insulin dose modification in this population, the broader metabolic and inflammatory consequences-particularly those related to cardiovascular risk-are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 25% reduction in total daily insulin dose on hemodialysis days in T2DM patients with ESRD, focusing on daily blood glucose profiles, glycated albumin, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. A multicenter study with clinical trials was designed in five hemodialysis centers. It was a 4-week clinical trial involving 17 eligible type 2 diabetic patients with ESRD on insulin therapy and regular hemodialysis. Self-monitoring blood glucose was performed seven times a day before, during, and 1\u2009month after the intervention. Blood samples were collected before and after the intervention. The Wilcoxon test was used to assess differences in daily glucose profiles, glycated albumin, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 before and after insulin dose adjustment. After 1\u2009month of adjusting total daily insulin dose during hemodialysis, no statistically significant difference was observed in daily blood glucose, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels. However, glycated albumin levels increased both before and after the insulin dosage modification. Reducing the total daily insulin dose by 25% during hemodialysis day effectively reduces hypoglycemia incidence intra- and post-hemodialysis in T2DM patients with ESRD without impacting pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, which are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk."

This study aims to compare septic and aseptic RHA cases in terms of inflammatory markers, prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), surgical time, blood transfusion requirements, soft tissue thickness, and mortality rates. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 49 patients who underwent RHA between 2015 and 2020. Patients were divided into aseptic (n=34) and septic (n=15) groups. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, preoperative erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, soft tissue thickness, and revision surgery time were compared. RESULTS ESR and CRP levels were significantly higher in the septic group (p=0.002, p=0.001), soft tissue thickness was lower (p=0.003), blood transfusion requirements (p&lt;0.001) and surgical times (p&lt;0.00001) were higher, while no significant difference was found in mortality rates between the groups (p=0.576). CONCLUSIONS This study examined septic and aseptic loosening in revision hip arthroplasty, finding higher inflammatory markers, increased transfusion needs, longer operative times, and greater infection risk with diabetes in septic cases. In our study, soft tissue thickness was found to be lower in infected cases, unlike the literature. While previous studies suggested that soft tissue thickness was the cause of infection, our study indicates that the decrease in skin thickness is a consequence of infection."

        "Abstract":"Fetal growth restriction\u00a0increases the risk of metabolic conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). One-carbon metabolite and nutrient concentrations are dysregulated in GDM and influenced by antihyperglycaemic medications. However, it remains unclear whether disrupted one-carbon metabolism contributes to GDM onset in growth restricted offspring and whether antihyperglycaemic medications exacerbate this dysregulation. We investigated the effects of growth restriction and antihyperglycaemic treatment on one-carbon metabolism in pregnant rats and their fetuses. Uteroplacental insufficiency (Restricted) or sham (Control) surgery was performed on embryonic day (E)18 in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Female F1 offspring were mated and Restricted dams received daily metformin, insulin or vehicle from E13. Although restricted dams did not develop metabolic dysfunction during pregnancy, they exhibited reduced one-carbon metabolism and a lower S-adenosylmethionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAM:SAH)\u00a0ratio, indicating reduced methylation capacity. These changes were exacerbated by both metformin and insulin. In F2 fetuses, plasma one-carbon metabolites were unaffected despite changes in expression of genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation in the placenta and fetal liver. F2 fetuses displayed an elevated pancreatic \u03b2-cell:islet ratio. Antihyperglycaemic medications altered the expression of multiple one-carbon metabolising enzymes in the maternal liver, the placenta junctional zone and the fetal liver. Metformin also increased pancreatic \u03b1-cell area. This study suggests disrupted one-carbon metabolism may underly programmed metabolic dysfunction and highlights the need for monitoring females born small. Both metformin and insulin induced similar physiological changes indicating that one is not safer than the other. Treatment decisions should consider potential impacts on long-term health. KEY POINTS: Being born growth restricted predisposes females to develop gestational diabetes (GDM) contributing to intergenerational transmission of disease. GDM is often treated with metformin or insulin. Disruptions to one-carbon metabolism caused by growth restriction, insulin or metformin may explain transmission of disease. This study investigated the effects of growth restriction, metformin and insulin on one-carbon metabolism and subsequent fetal outcomes in rats. Growth restriction impaired one-carbon metabolism in mothers resulting in a reduced S-adenosylmethionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, changes to expression of associated enzymes in the placenta and fetal liver and an increase in the fetal \u03b2-cell: pancreatic islet ratio. Metformin and insulin exacerbated deficits in one-carbon metabolism in growth restricted dams and their fetuses, whereas metformin also increased pancreatic \u03b1-cell area. This study demonstrates one-carbon metabolism as a key regulator of programmed metabolic disease in pregnancy and informs about the appropriate treatment of GDM in women born growth restricted."

        "Abstract":"We have previously shown that sitagliptin, a widely used dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, effectively reduces social fear in an animal model that closely mimics the main behavioral symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD). This social fear conditioning (SFC) model induces social fear without comorbidities in the short term, but over time, a depressive-like phenotype emerges, mimicking the comorbidity often observed in SAD patients. In this study, we investigated the effects of two DPP4 inhibitors, vildagliptin and linagliptin, both of which have distinct pharmacokinetic profiles compared to sitagliptin, on social fear and the prevention of comorbid depressive-like behavior. We show that administration of vildagliptin (50\u00a0mg\/kg\/day and 100\u00a0mg\/kg\/day) and linagliptin (5\u00a0mg\/kg\/day and 10\u00a0mg\/kg\/day) via the drinking water significantly reduced social fear in male CD1 mice subjected to SFC. Importantly, both gliptins also prevented the onset of comorbid depressive-like behavior in these mice. These results have important clinical connotations, as they suggest that early treatment with DPP4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin and linagliptin could serve as promising therapeutic strategy for SAD, not only reducing the main symptoms of social anxiety but also the risk of developing comorbid mood disorders that often exacerbate the severity of symptoms and complicate treatment outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Obesity is a global health challenge that can lead to various complications, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases. Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved chaperones that help maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Their expression is dysregulated in various chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, and they also regulate inflammatory processes. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of a small heat shock protein, HSPB1, on the comorbidities and complications of obesity in a transgenic mouse model. Male and female human apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB) transgenic mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) from months 3-10 of age were used as a model of metabolic syndrome (MetS). To study whether HSPB1 influences the development of MetS, APOB animals were crossed with HSPB1-overexpressing mice. Age and sex-matched wild-type and human HSPB1-overexpressing mice were used as controls. Changes in cardiac morphology and function were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography at month 9. At month 10, serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays. Pathological changes in the liver were studied on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Expression levels of genes involved in inflammation and metabolism were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the liver, left ventricle, and visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT). The body weight and serum LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the APOB animals than in the wild-type mice in both sexes. Notably, HSPB1 overexpression further increased weight gain in female APOB animals. Conversely, in APOB males, HSPB1 overexpression decreased LDL-cholesterol levels without significantly affecting body weight. Furthermore, in APOB females, HSPB1 overexpression elevated Fgf-21 expression in the vWAT, restored Lpl levels, and reduced the expression of several cytokines in the liver. APOB males developed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with diastolic dysfunction. HSPB1 overexpression induced LVH without cardiac dysfunction in the wild-type animals. Both sexes of APOB animals developed MetS. APOB males presented LVH with preserved ejection fraction (EF); however, APOB females showed enlarged left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV). In APOB animals, HSPB1 overexpression exerted a sex-dependent influence on obesity-related alterations, including weight gain, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic and vWAT gene expression."

        "Abstract":"Stroke is the second leading global cause of death\/disability, with 85% being ischemic. DM increases Stroke prevalence and worsens outcomes. While the TyG Index shows inconsistent Stroke prediction in DM, chronic inflammation drives pathology. MAR, reflecting integrated inflammation status, has prognostic value but lacks evidence for association with Stroke prevalence across glycemic states (diabetes\/prediabetes\/non-diabetes). This NHANES study evaluates MAR-Stroke associations and compares predictive performance with TyG Index in DM. This NHANES 2005-2018 analysis included 70,190 adults (\u2265\u200920\u00a0years). After excluding participants with missing Stroke data or key variables, 15,679 were included in the analysis. We employed weighted multivariable logistic regression (stratified by diabetes\/prediabetes\/non-diabetes), RCS curves for nonlinearity, ROC analysis comparing MAR\/ TyG Index discriminatory ability, and BMI mediation analysis. NHANES sampling weights and covariate adjustments for age, gender, race, education, and BMI were applied. Based on a cross-sectional analysis of the 2005-2018 NHANES database (sample size n\u2009=\u200915,679; Stroke prevalence 2.9%), the findings indicate that: In the general population, each 1-unit increase in MAR was associated with a 13% higher prevalence of Stroke (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20091.13, 95% CI: 1.03,1.24). This association was stronger among diabetic patients (OR\u2009=\u20091.23, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.41) and exhibited a near-linear dose-response relationship (P for nonlinearity\u2009=\u20090.013).MAR showed superior potential biomarker for Stroke (AUC\u2009=\u20090.594) compared with TyG Index (AUC\u2009=\u20090.583) and LDL (AUC\u2009=\u20090.568). After multivariate adjustment, MAR achieved an AUC of 0.808 (95% CI: 0.793,0.823). Mediation analysis revealed that BMI mediated 15.6% of MAR's effect on Stroke prevalence (indirect effect \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.314, 95% CI: 0.136,0.508). This NHANES analysis (N\u2009=\u200915,679) establishes elevated MAR as significantly associated with prevalent Stroke, outperforming the TyG Index especially in diabetics. Diabetic individuals in the highest MAR quartile exhibited 2.5-fold greater Stroke prevalence vs. the lowest quartile, with optimal prevalence discrimination at MAR\u2009>\u20090.152. BMI mediated 15.6% of this association, indicating modifiable pathways. Clinical translation requires prospective validation of the MAR threshold, confirmation of BMI-mediated mechanisms, and evidence for MAR-guided intervention efficacy. Provided sufficient longitudinal and interventional evidence is obtained, MAR shows promise as a dual-purpose tool for Stroke prevalence stratification and therapeutic monitoring along the inflammation-metabolism axis in high-risk populations, particularly diabetics."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating complications of diabetes, marked by chronic neuroinflammation, immune dysregulation, and progressive neuronal degeneration. Current treatments offer limited efficacy, largely focusing on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. There is a critical need for disease-modifying therapies that target the molecular basis of DPN. In this study, we developed a novel targeted nanotherapeutic system-ZH-1c-EVs@SIN-composed of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) modified with the ZH-1c aptamer and loaded with the anti-inflammatory compound sinomenine (SIN). This system was specifically designed to target microglia and inhibit the WNT5a\/TRPV1 signaling pathway. Transcriptomic profiling of microglia revealed key gene networks implicated in DPN pathology and responsive to SIN treatment. Functional assays demonstrated that ZH-1c-EVs@SIN facilitated a shift in microglial phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2, significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, and restored levels of neuronal regulatory proteins. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed optimal vesicle size and morphology, while fluorescence imaging showed efficient uptake by microglia. In vivo studies in a murine model of DPN revealed marked improvements in pain-related behavior and histopathological signs of nerve damage. ZH-1c-EVs@SIN represents a promising therapeutic strategy for DPN, offering targeted immunomodulation and enhanced neural repair via regulation of the WNT5a\/TRPV1 signaling axis. This nano-delivery platform introduces a novel and precise approach to intervening in diabetic neuropathy and may be applicable to other neuroinflammatory conditions."

        "Abstract":"The increasing global prevalence of diabetic nephropathy poses substantial health and economic burdens. Currently, effective anti-fibrotic therapies for managing kidney fibrosis associated with chronic kidney disease are lacking. This study reveals corisin, a microbiota-derived peptide, as a central driver in the progression of diabetic kidney fibrosis. Corisin levels were found to be markedly elevated in the serum of diabetic chronic kidney disease patients relative to healthy controls, with strong correlations to advanced disease stages and declining renal function. In a murine model of kidney fibrosis, corisin levels were similarly heightened, directly contributing to increased inflammation and worsening fibrosis and renal impairment. Notably, the use of a monoclonal anti-corisin antibody significantly reduced nephropathy severity in diabetic mice. Through molecular dynamics simulations and experimental validation, we demonstrated that corisin interacts with human serum albumin, potentially enhancing its renal accumulation and pathological impact. The pathogenic mechanism of corisin involves the acceleration of cellular senescence and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis in kidney cells. These findings underscore the critical role of corisin in progressive diabetic nephropathy and suggest a promising new target for therapeutic intervention."

        "Abstract":"Approximately 30-40% of patients with diabetes develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Identifying decisive factors for DKD initiation is crucial. Here, we observed that glomerular podocytes in male and female patients with DKD and db\/db mice specifically displayed BCAA catabolic defects. Podocyte-specific PP2Cm (a key BCAA catabolism enzyme) knockout or exogenous BCAA supplementation induced DKD phenotypes including podocyte dysfunction\/apoptosis, glomerular pathology, and proteinuria in high-fat (HF)-diet-fed male mice. Mechanistically, BCAAs promoted PKM2 depolymerization and inactivation in podocytes. Depolymerized PKM2 suppressed glucose oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), diverting glucose metabolism towards serine biosynthesis and folate metabolism. Depolymerized PKM2 is also co-transported with DDIT3 into the nucleus, acting as a co-transcriptional factor to enhance DDIT3 transcriptional activity, which promotes Chac1 and Trib3 expression and directly inducing podocyte apoptosis. Thus, BCAA catabolic defects may be one of the missing factors that determine DKD initiation. Targeting BCAA catabolism or PKM2 activation is a promising DKD prevention strategy."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of disability and mortality, with endothelial dysfunction playing a key role in the development of non-healing ulcers. A primary driver of endothelial cell impairment in this context is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, triggered by glycolipotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we observed that diabetic mice displayed poor ulcer healing associated with reduced angiogenesis and downregulated Reticulocalbin 1 (RCN1) expression. Proteomic analysis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) identified a strong link between RCN1 and the damaging effects of glycolipotoxicity on endothelial cell function, leading to impaired tubule formation, reduced migratory capacity, and increased apoptosis in endothelial cells. Mechanistic RNA sequencing analysis highlighted a significant role for RCN1 in regulating ER function. RCN1 overexpression alleviated ER stress by reducing Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) phosphorylation and C\/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression, both induced by glycolipotoxicity or Thapsigargin (TG), while RCN1 silencing intensified these effects. Additionally, TRIM11-mediated ubiquitination, influenced by glycolipotoxicity, regulated RCN1 stability, specifically promoting angiogenesis through RCN1 modulation. RCN1 overexpression accelerated ulcer healing in diabetic mice by suppressing ER stress proteins and enhancing angiogenesis, whereas RCN1 inhibition further delayed ulcer healing. In human DFU samples, proteomic analysis revealed that low RCN1 levels were linked to disrupted ER functional proteins, with RCN1 serum levels decreasing as diabetes progressed to DFU. Following surgical debridement treatment, RCN1 levels increased in patients with improved DFU healing outcomes. These findings suggest that ER stress, initiated by RCN1 inhibition in response to glycolipotoxicity, leads to endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis, ultimately contributing to the non-healing of DFUs."

        "Title":"A Review of Modulation of Gut Microbiota to Mitigate Gestational Diabetes: Implications for Maternal and Child Health.",
        "Abstract":"The increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pressing global public health concern. Despite extensive identification of GDM risk factors and the implementation of screening programs, there has been a notable lack of significant reduction in maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. It is vital to recognize that the health trajectory of future generations begins before birth, during intrauterine life and even before conception. The development of 'diabetogenic' and 'obesogenic' changes in the DNA of offspring can be triggered not only by adverse intrauterine conditions, but also by changes in germ cell DNA at earlier stages. Accumulating evidence suggests that the increasing prevalence and persistent metabolic effects of GDM may be mediated by epigenetic modifications. The composition of the human gut microbiota is emerging as a key determinant of human metabolic processes. Consequently, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota via epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to metabolic complications in both the mother and the developing fetus. Given that diet plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy microbiota profile and that certain epigenetic alterations are reversible, it is pertinent to emphasize that not only the pregnant woman but also both partners attempting conception could influence the future health of the child. The aim of this article is to review the role of gut microbiota modulation in preventing and managing gestational diabetes mellitus and the health benefits for mother and child."

        "Abstract":"Studies have compared diabetes management quality indicators, focusing on physiological markers such as hemoglobin A1c, between cancer survivors with diabetes and general diabetes patients. However, research comparing differences in diabetes self-management behaviors and the factors influencing them between these groups is lacking. This study aimed to compare self-management behaviors, guided by the information-motivation-behavior model, between cancer survivors with diabetes and general diabetes patients. In addition, we aimed to identify differences in factors such as diabetes knowledge, attitudes, family support, and self-efficacy that may influence diabetes self-management behaviors in both groups. A total of 125 cancer survivors with diabetes and 126 general diabetes patients participated in this cross-sectional study. A structured questionnaire assessed demographics, diabetes knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors. Regarding diabetes education, 47.0% of cancer survivors and 61.6% of general diabetes patients received education. The cancer survivors had lower diabetes knowledge scores (10.30 \u00b1 4.15, P < .001), a lower perceived value of strict blood glucose control (4.10 \u00b1 0.56, P < .001), and less family support (15.50 \u00b1 7.50, P = .019) than the patients without cancer (13.51 \u00b1 3.84, 4.25 \u00b1 0.65, and 17.57 \u00b1 6.40, respectively). This study reveals significant differences in diabetes self-management between cancer survivors and general diabetes patients. Cancer survivors showed lower diabetes knowledge, glucose control perception, and family support. These findings highlight the need for tailored self-management programs for cancer survivors. This study offers insights for developing tailored diabetes self-management programs and educational interventions for cancer survivors."

        "Abstract":"This study aims at find hit compounds as SGLT2 inhibitors through the methods of virtual screening, biological experiment, Structural similarity search and molecular docking. Computer-aided drug design techniques were used to build modelling of quantitative construct validity relationships. Three-dimensional pharmacophore model and the principle of drug properties were used to screen the compounds. The effects of lead compounds on glucose uptake were observed in 293\u00a0T cells. Further, structural similarity searches were conducted on 13 hit compounds, then molecular docking the compounds with proteins was performed. Based on virtual screening, 20 highly rated compounds as potential lead candidates for diabetes treatment were selected. Combining the results in glucose uptake assays, 13 hit compounds were identified with strong inhibitory properties against SGLT2, especially, compound 2 had the lowest glucose uptake and the best inhibition of SGLT2. The compounds were classified into 5 classes and each class has the same core skeleton. Molecular docking cleared and definite that the hit compounds had stable and efficient hydrogen-bonding interactions with SGLT2, and their binding to SGLT2 was specific. 13 hit compounds were identified with strong inhibitory properties against SGLT2, and they are likely to become new SGLT2 inhibitors to treat diabetes."

        "Abstract":"Accurate localization and segmentation of the optic disc (OD) are considered crucial for the early detection of ophthalmic diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Challenges such as image quality variability, high background noise, and insufficient edge information are often encountered by existing methods. To address these issues, an adaptive framework is proposed in which Fast Circlet Transformation (FCT) is combined with entropy-based features derived from retinal blood vessels for robust OD localization. Minkowski weighted K-means clustering is utilized to dynamically assess feature importance, thereby enhancing resilience to dataset variations. Following localization, partial differential equation-based image inpainting is employed for blood vessel removal, and OD segmentation is refined using the Chan-Vese active contour model. The method's localization efficacy is demonstrated through extensive evaluations across multiple public datasets (DRISHTI-GS, DRIONS-DB, IDRID, and ORIGA), and segmentation performance metrics, including Dice coefficients of 0.94-0.95 and Jaccard indices of 0.9, are achieved on the ORIGA and DRISHTI-GS datasets. Through these results, the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method for clinical applications in retinal image analysis are highlighted."

General scaffold of these compounds was designed based on the reported potent \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitors and derivation was performed in acetamide moiety. In vitro evaluation of the new compounds 12a-o demonstrated that most of the synthesized compounds were more potent than standard inhibitor acarbose against \u03b1-glucosidase while all these new compounds were more potent than acaerbose against \u03b1-amylase. The most potent compound against both studied enzymes was compound 12n that was a 4-fluorophenylacetamide derivative. This compound was 5 and 23.8 folds more potent than acarbose against \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase, respectively, and with excellent binding energies in comparison to acarbose attached to active sites of these enzymes. Molecular dynamics and pharmacokinetic studies of compound 12n was also performed."

        "Abstract":"While diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD), its impact on plaque characteristics across different intracranial vascular territories remains unclear. Patients with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis were recruited from a multi-center study of ICASMAP. Plaque characteristics, including the location, plaque burden measured by normalized wall index (NWI), luminal stenosis, length, T1 hyperintense, enhancement grade, and the enhancement ratio of atherosclerotic plaques were evaluated. Plaque characteristics were compared between patients with and without DM and the association between DM and plaque characteristics was analyzed. Of 171 recruited patients (mean age: 59.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.9\u00a0years; 91 males), 76 (44.4\u00a0%) had DM. Diabetic patients had significantly greater luminal stenosis (49.6\u00a0%\u00b125.6\u00a0% vs. 29.3\u00a0%\u00b118.0\u00a0%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), length of plaque (9.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0mm vs. 7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0mm, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), NWI (82.9\u00a0%\u00b113.0\u00a0% vs. 75.9\u00a0%\u00b115.4\u00a0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), plaque enhancement Grade 0 (22.4\u00a0% vs. 48.0\u00a0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and plaque enhancement Grade 1 (72.4\u00a0% vs. 48.0\u00a0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) in the ophthalmic and communion segment of the internal carotid artery compared with non-diabetic patients. In the basilar artery, there were significant differences in luminal stenosis (57.5\u00a0%\u00b128.3\u00a0% vs. 42.5\u00a0%\u00b125.8\u00a0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.026), length of plaque (16.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2\u00a0mm vs. 10.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0mm, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and plaque enhancement Grade 1 (77.1\u00a0% vs. 51.4\u00a0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.025) between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. No significant differences were observed in the M1-2 segment of the middle cerebral artery or the V4 segment of the vertebral artery. Adjusting for confounding factors, the differences remained statistically significant in luminal stenosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), NWI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011), plaque enhancement Grade 1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.033), and plaque enhancement Grade 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048) in the ophthalmic and communion segments of internal carotid artery and luminal stenosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), length of plaque (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) in basilar artery between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Health services and systems co-design. Health services in South Australia providing maternal and child primary, acute and chronic disease management care. Nineteen Aboriginal women from urban, regional and remote areas of South Australia participated in 2024, with most having personal experience of cardiometabolic complications in pregnancy and some contributing professional experience. Development of a culturally responsive, evidence-based model of care to support Aboriginal women with cardiometabolic complications in pregnancy. Through a collaborative approach and an iterative co-design process, participants shared lived experiences, identified systemic issues and developed solutions to address gaps in maternal and child health care. Culturally safe spaces enabled deep reflection, open dialogue and collective decision making. With this, we developed a model of care that included a vision statement, guiding principles, a conceptual framework and 18 priority areas. In addition, eight health system enablers were identified to support implementation. This project demonstrates the value of Aboriginal women's leadership in shaping health systems. This process highlights the value of culturally grounded, community-led co-design approaches to health service and system reform. For health systems and service providers and managers, this is an opportunity to foster meaningful change by listening to and acting on the voices of Aboriginal women. In doing so, they will meet their responsibility to address inequities. Researchers and health organisations must do more than amplify these voices; rather, they must listen, act and ensure that systems respond to what women say they need. This is a pivotal moment to drive systemic change for equitable and culturally safe maternal and child health care."

To our knowledge, limited studies have examined the risk factors of recurrent DKA in the Saudi T1DM population. To identify factors contributing to recurrent DKA in Saudi patients with T1DM. By identifying the contributing factors for DKA recurrence the disease burden can be mitigated by making targeted interventions. Retrospective. Tertiary care center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Saudi patients with T1DM admitted with DKA between 2021 to 2023 were included. A comparative analysis was performed between patients with a single recurrence of DKA and those with multiple recurrent admissions. Association between multiple variables and recurrent DKA. 245 Saudi patients with T1DM. A total of 245 Saudi patients with T1DM were included. A significantly higher proportion of females were observed in the multiple recurrent DKA group (73.1% vs. 48.5%, <i>P<\/i>=.0001). Also, a higher proportion of single individuals were found among the multiple recurrent DKA group (<i>P<\/i>=.006). Longer duration of T1DM (\u22655 years) and presence of microalbuminuria were more associated with multiple recurrent DKA than single recurrence of DKA. Among the precipitating factors, non-adherence to medications was associated with multiple recurrence of DKA (<i>P<\/i>=.02). This study has identified several risk factors contributing to recurrent DKA episodes among Saudi patients with T1DM. By increasing awareness of these factors among both healthcare providers and the community, we can develop more effective prevention strategies and ultimately reduce the incidence of recurrent DKA.

        "Abstract":"Long-term hyperglycemia and insulin dysfunction deteriorate peripheral nerve functions, leading to sensory loss, spontaneous pain, and hypersensitivity (i.e., allodynia and hyperalgesia). Evidence indicates glucose-induced upregulation of the Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin mechanism in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Eriodictyol (Ed) has shown protective effects against glucotoxicity. The present study explored the bioactivity of Ed in streptozotocin (STZ) induced DPN and the role of the Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Ed or gabapentin (Gpn), or methyl vanillate (MV) was administered in Wistar rats for 4\u00a0weeks, starting 6\u00a0weeks after STZ administration. Ed ameliorated the mean body weight and mitigated polydipsia and polyphagia in DPN rats. The data indicated that Ed attenuated hyperglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and HOMA-IR, and enhanced circulating insulin levels and HOMA-\u03b2 against STZ-induced DPN. MV (Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin activator) caused a significant increase in STZ-induced hyperglycemia, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and further decreased the insulin levels and HOMA-\u03b2 in STZ-treated rats. Ed attenuated oxidative stress, inflammatory expression, level of advanced glycation end products, and nuclear factor kappa B in the sciatic nerve of STZ-treated neuropathic rats, and MV further potentiated these markers triggered by STZ. Interestingly, Ed and Gpn attenuated mRNA expression of Wnt1\/\u03b2-catenin in the sciatic nerve of neuropathic rats. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were significantly ameliorated in Ed or Gpn-treated rats against DPN. Furthermore, Ed ameliorated the biochemical biomarkers, histopathological characteristics, and nociceptive-like responses in STZ and MV-treated rats. It is concluded that Ed can alleviate the pathogenic course of DPN. Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be involved in the eriodyctiol-triggered mitigation of nociceptive-like responses in diabetic rats."

While, rotator cuff (RC) tendinosis is frequently observed, to our knowledge, there is no study indicating its link to adhesive capsulitis. This study aimed to assess the prevalence RC tendinosis in adhesive capsulitis and examine associations between adhesive capsulitis and hypertension, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, and inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) thickness. This retrospective study included 503 patients with adhesive capsulitis who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulder. Patients with previous shoulder trauma, surgery, or rheumatologic disease were excluded. Clinical data on hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid dysfunction were collected. The IGHL thickness was measured, and RC tendinosis was classified according to tendon involvement. Statistical analyses included t\u00a0tests, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Rotator cuff tendinosis was observed in 76.94% of patients, with supraspinatus tendinosis being the most common (74.95%). Thyroid dysfunction was significantly more prevalent in patients with adhesive capsulitis (15.90%, p\u202f<\u20090.001), while hypertension was lower (21.87%, p\u202f<\u20090.001) compared to the general population. The prevalence of diabetes (12.52%) was not significantly different from the general population (p\u202f=\u20090.426). Diabetes was associated with increased IGHL thickness (p\u202f=\u20090.005), whereas thyroid dysfunction was linked to lower IGHL thickness (p\u202f=\u20090.023). The IGHL thickness did not predict tendinosis (AUC\u202f=\u20090.47). Supraspinatus tendinosis is overrepresented in patients with adhesive capsulitis, with a\u00a0prevalence of 75%. Thyroid dysfunction may contribute to its pathogenesis as indicated in previous research. Additionally, IGHL thickness alone is not a\u00a0reliable predictor of tendinosis.

Educational interventions, including traditional education, psychoeducational, and psychosocial programs, are increasingly recognized as supporting self-care and promoting psychological well-being. This scoping review aims to systematically map the existing literature on educational programs for individuals with T1DM, with a specific focus on their impact on mental health outcomes. The review was conducted according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and guided by the Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework. A comprehensive search was performed across six major biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO), including studies that examined educational interventions addressing mental health in individuals with T1DM. A total of 18 studies were included, covering a range of educational interventions, such as digital tools, psychological therapies (e.g., ACT, CBT), and self-care interventions, most of which were delivered by multidisciplinary teams. Many interventions demonstrated positive effects on mental health, including reduced anxiety, enhanced mood, and improved self-management. Key facilitators included professional support, peer involvement, and the integration of psychological components. Barriers included high dropout rates and limited tailoring to age-specific needs. Educational interventions can positively influence mental health outcomes in individuals with T1DM. However, the literature remains fragmented, and program effectiveness varies. There is a pressing need for more flexible, personalized, and age-sensitive educational interventions that incorporate emotional and psychological support and address implementation challenges."

        "Abstract":"Carotid artery stenosis carries not only risk for ischemic strokes but also for other fatal cardiovascular events. Therefore, the control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors as smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus is of primary importance in patients with carotid stenosis irrespectively of symptoms. This strategy is based on combination of lifestyle measures with pharmacotherapy. The basic lifestyle rule is expressed by the numbers 0-5-30; which mean 0 cigarettes, 5 portions of vegetables and fruits per day and 30 minutes of exercise per day. Very low concentrations of atherogenic LDL cholesterol (in patients at the highest risk less than 1.4 mmol\/L) are to be reached; it is recently achievable by wide spectrum of potent hypolipemic drugs. In hypertension, the optimal levels of systolic blood pressure are 130-140 mmHg; in severe bilateral carotid stenoses slower lowering of blood pressure is recommended. Similarly, in diabetic individuals, hypoglycemia should be avoided caused by too intensive anti-diabetic treatment. Nevertheless, recently available antidiabetic drugs are less dangerous in this respect. Other risk factors recently under scrutiny are lipoprotein(a) and subclinical inflammation. Finally, very frequent but often critical and neglected risk factor is nonadherence of patients to cardiovascular risk management."

Placental tissues from 30 GDM patients and normal pregnancy cases were collected. The expression of HOX family genes (including HOXB13 and HOXA2 among seven genes) was screened using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the protein expression of HOXB13 was validated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Untargeted metabolomics analysis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed to examine metabolic differences in placental tissues, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment was applied to interpret metabolic regulation networks. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of HOXB13 were significantly lower in the GDM placentas compared to the normal pregnancy group. A total of 337 differential metabolites were identified, with the highest proportion being lipids and lipid-like molecules (37.96%). The levels of glucose and galactose in the GDM group were significantly reduced. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that these differential metabolites were enriched in pathways related to steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism. We conclude that HOXB13 is downregulated in GDM placentas, and its expression is closely associated with dysregulated glucose-lipid metabolism and abnormalities in key metabolic pathways. HOXB13 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for GDM.

        "Abstract":"The present study investigated the effect of the lifestyle-based health promotion intervention on health behaviour, irrational health beliefs, and eating behaviour of patients with type 2 diabetes. For this purpose, 90 patients with type 2 diabetes were selected by convenience sampling and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups, each comprising 45 patients. The experimental group received eight 90-min sessions of lifestyle-based health promotion intervention, while the control group received no treatment. The data were collected by the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile, Irrational Health Belief Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, administered to the participants at the pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up phases and analysed by the analysis of variance. The results indicated that the mean score of health behaviours of the experimental group improved. In contrast, the mean scores of their eating behaviour and irrational health beliefs decreased compared with the control group (P\u2009<\u2009.01). The findings of this study underscore the significant impact of lifestyle-based health promotion interventions on patients with type 2 diabetes. Consequently, practitioners and healthcare professionals might include lifestyle-based health promotion interventions in the standard treatment programs for patients with type 2 diabetes to promote their health and treatment outcomes."

        "Abstract":"To investigate the natural history of diabetes mellitus (DM) based on metabolic phenotypes of prediabetes in a community-based prospective study. Individuals aged 40-69 years without DM were followed for 20 years. Glycemic parameters, including the 75\u00a0g oral glucose tolerance test, were assessed at baseline and biennially thereafter. Markov models were used to estimate each glycemic state's annual transition probabilities and average total length of residence. Among the 7,676 participants without DM, 205 had isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG), and 1,753 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at baseline. During the 17.5 years of follow-up, 2,313 (30.1%) cases of DM occurred. The annual transition to DM for those with iIFG was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.9, 8.5) and 6.9% (95% CI 6.6, 7.3) for those with IGT. In the normoglycemia\u00a0\u2194\u00a0iIFG\u00a0\u2192\u00a0DM model, the total length in normoglycemia was 49.4 years (95% CI 47.0, 52.1), and the length in iIFG was 6.3 years (95% CI 5.9, 6.8).

        "Abstract":"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents the initial phase of cardiac dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To date, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM-induced HFpEF are complex and elusive. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a prolyl-specific serine protease that its inhibition or vaccination has been shown to enhance cardiac repair following myocardial infarction (MI). However, the role and underlying molecular mechanisms by which abnormal FAP activity promotes the development of T2DM-induced HFpEF remain to be elucidated. In this study, the plasma activity and level of FAP were significantly higher in the T2DM with HFpEF group compared to the healthy control group. Moreover, plasma FAP activity and level were positively correlated with the likelihood of T2DM with HFpEF. To investigate the mechanistic involvement of FAP in the development of T2DM-associated HFpEF, a chronic T2DM mouse model was established. The results revealed that FAP KO significantly improved BNP level and E\/A ratios compared to the WT T2DM group. Additionally, FAP KO and FAP inhibitor Talabostat alleviated myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress and energy metabolism dysfunction. Mechanistically, abnormal increase FAP triggered the CaMKII\u03b4-Calcineurin A-NFATc2 signaling pathway, leading to the aforementioned pathological changes in T2DM-induced HFpEF. In contrast, FAP KO suppressed the CaMKII\u03b4-Calcineurin A-NFATc2 signaling pathway and attenuated these pathological changes. Overall, these findings suggest that FAP may serve as a critical therapeutic target for T2DM-induced HFpEF."

        "Abstract":"Endovascular below-the-knee (BTK) revascularization is safe and effective in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), but outcomes depend on the severity of limb ischemia, anatomical pattern, comorbidity, and degree of vessel calcification. The most commonly used peripheral calcification score, the peripheral arterial calcium scoring system (PACSS), is angiography based and is therefore limited by low sensitivity and interobserver agreement. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of the original and a modified PACSS (mPACSS) based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging on short-term outcomes after BTK endovascular interventions. All consecutive patients included in the prospective Dutch Chronic Lower Limb-Threatening Ischemia Registry (THRILLER) between February 2021 and July 2023 who underwent CTA imaging within 6\u2009months before the procedure were included. The mPACSS also takes calcification of the entire target vessel into account. Primary outcomes were limb salvage and amputation-free survival (AFS) at 3\u2009months. Secondary outcomes were technical success, primary patency, and overall survival. In total, 419 patients with 473 limbs were included (mean age 74.1\u2009\u00b1\u200910.2\u2009years; 71.1% male). PACSS 4 was present in 39.7% of the limbs and associated with higher age and higher rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular morbidity, wound, ischemia, foot infection stage, global limb anatomic staging system stage and use of stents. In multivariable analysis, PACSS 4 was significantly associated with lower limb salvage (hazard ratio [HR] 2.75, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.49-5.08, <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u2009.001) and AFS (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.07-2.53, <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u2009.025), as was mPACSS \u22655 (limb salvage: HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.88-5.46, <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u2009.015; AFS: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.06-2.65, <i>P<\/i>\u2009=\u2009.026). No significant differences were found in terms of technical success, primary patency, and overall survival. Both PACSS and mPACSS scored on CTA imaging are significantly associated with 3-month limb salvage and AFS after BTK endovascular interventions.Clinical ImpactCurrent peripheral calcification scores are based on angiography and limited by a low sensitivity and minimal interobserver agreement. Scoring the original and modified peripheral arterial calcium scoring system (mPACSS) on computed tomography angiography (CTA) has proven to be more reliable and fast. Accordingly, this study shows that both PACSS and mPACSS scored on CTA are independent predictors of 3-month outcomes after below-the-knee interventions. This reinforces the importance of using a reliable peripheral calcification score in the preoperative assessment of CLTI patients eligible for revascularization. Future evaluations in larger cohorts with longer follow-up should investigate the PACSS and mPACSS in different clinical contexts and whether either score is superior."

        "Abstract":"Older men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) face a heightened risk of sarcopenia. This study aimed to compare the longitudinal effects of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sitagliptin as the control group on sarcopenia indicators and biomarkers of neuromuscular junction and neuronal health in patients with T2DM over 1 year. A cohort of 141 older men with T2DM (semaglutide, n\u2009=\u00a068; sitagliptin group, n\u2009=\u00a073) underwent assessments at baseline, 6\u00a0months and 1 year. Measured parameters included handgrip strength (HGS), gait speed, appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), short physical performance battery (SPPB) and plasma concentrations of C-terminal agrin fragment 22 (CAF22), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Over the study period, the semaglutide group exhibited significant reductions in HGS, gait speed, ASMI and SPPB scores (all P\u2009<\u2009.05). Concurrently, this group exhibited more pronounced elevation of plasma CAF22 and NfL levels compared to the sitagliptin group (all P\u2009<\u2009.05). Among the patients taking semaglutide, higher CAF22 and NfL levels generally correlated with poorer HGS, ASMI and SPPB scores. In contrast, lower BDNF levels were associated with reduced ASMI and SPPB at specific time points (all P\u2009<\u2009.05). Multiple regression analysis confirmed significant negative associations between CAF22 and NfL, and a positive association between BDNF and sarcopenia parameters, specifically among patients taking semaglutide. Semaglutide treatment in older men with T2DM may be associated with a decline in muscle strength and physical performance, potentially associated with neuromuscular junction degradation and neuronal damage. These findings underscore the importance of closely monitoring musculoskeletal health in patients receiving semaglutide."

        "Abstract":"Emerging evidence links low physical activity (PA) and dysregulated lipid metabolism to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. This study aimed to determine which gestational stage is more vulnerable to low PA and whether changes in blood lipids mediate this risk. A retrospective analysis was conducted among 3997 pregnant women (614 with GDM) during the COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai, a unique natural experiment provided by the uniform imposition of PA restrictions. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between low PA at different gestational stages and GDM risk, while mediation analyses explored the role of blood lipids. Women with GDM were older and had higher rates of overweight\/obesity compared with non-GDM participants. Notably, the GDM group exhibited a higher prevalence of low PA during early pregnancy and elevated lipid levels. Logistic regression demonstrated that low PA during early pregnancy was significantly associated with increased GDM risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.041, 95% CI: 1.577-2.644). Moreover, low PA was significantly linked to dysregulated lipid profiles in both early and mid-pregnancy. Mediation analysis further indicated that elevated total cholesterol (TC) levels partially mediated this relationship. In contrast, low PA in mid-pregnancy was not directly linked to GDM (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.244, 95% CI: 0.966-1.6), although increased triglyceride (TG) levels during this stage mediated an effect on GDM risk. Early pregnancy is a critical window for GDM prevention. Additionally, these findings advocate for stage-specific exercise and lipid management strategies to reduce GDM risk and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Significant effort has been made in recent years to identify environmental factors-particularly perinatal exposures-that contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet many proposed associations remain inconsistent and inconclusive. Given the common use of labor induction for both medical indications and maternal preference, we aimed to investigate its potential association with ASD development, while accounting for synergistic factors that may influence its onset. A population-based cohort study was conducted at a tertiary referral center, focusing on singleton births. The study aimed to compare the occurrence of ASD in children, considering both hospital and community-based diagnoses, in relation to whether labor was induced (using mechanical cervical ripening or prostaglandins, with or without oxytocin) or began spontaneously. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was employed to assess the cumulative incidence of ASD, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to account for confounding variables. Among 115,081 births, 13,071 (11.4%) were labor induced, with the remainder beginning spontaneously. Pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns, were significantly more common in the labor induction group (p<0.001 for all). During follow-up, 767 children were diagnosed with ASD: 1.0% in the labor induction group and 0.6% in the spontaneous labor onset group (p<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly higher cumulative hazard for ASD diagnosis in the labor induction group (log-rank p-value <0.001). However, after adjusting for maternal and perinatal factors such as maternal age, cesarean delivery, ethnicity, and gestational conditions, no significant association was found between labor induction and ASD risk (adjusted HR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.99-1.47, p = 0.063). Labor induction was associated with a higher ASD incidence but not as an independent risk factor after adjusting for maternal and perinatal factors."

This retrospective study analyzed dried blood spot samples from 184 GDM and 167 control neonates. GDM was categorized as large-for-gestational-age (LGA) or appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA). Amino acid and acylcarnitine concentrations at 24-48\u2009h postnatal age were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). Neonatal hypoglycemia was defined and managed according to standard guidelines. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify clustering patterns. Tyrosine concentrations were significantly lower in the GDM-LGA group compared to the control-AGA group (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.018). Total carnitine levels were higher in GDM-LGA infants relative to controls (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05), reflecting increased fatty acid mobilization in larger infants. Specific long-chain acylcarnitines, such as C18:1 and C18:2, were lower in GDM group. whereas stearoyl carnitine (C18:0) was elevated, indicating an altered fatty acid oxidation profile. PCA revealed distinct metabolic patterns, suggesting early metabolic heterogeneity in GDM. The study identifies distinctive early metabolic profiles in neonates of gestational diabetic mothers, including lower tyrosine and altered acylcarnitine patterns, which may signal a predisposition to metabolic disorders. These findings support early metabolic screening protocols and targeted follow-up for high-risk infants. Longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm the predictive value of these biomarkers and to clarify the long-term impacts of metabolic disturbances in GDMs."

        "Abstract":"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs), widely used to treat HIV and hepatitis B, have recently been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting inflammasome activation. Epidemiological studies have revealed a significantly reduced incidence of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), among patients chronically treated with NRTIs, but not with other classes of antiretroviral drugs. In this short review, we explore the mechanistic and clinical evidence linking NRTIs to reduced inflammaging, with particular attention to their effects on endogenous retroelements such as LINEs, SINEs and human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). These elements, increasingly active with age, contribute to sterile inflammation and disease progression. NRTIs may mitigate this process by blocking reverse transcriptase-dependent formation of RNA:DNA hybrids and other immunostimulatory nucleic acid species. Although mitochondrial toxicity has been a concern, it mainly applies to older NRTIs and is much less pronounced with newer, safer compounds. NRTIs thus represent a compelling case for drug repurposing in the context of age-related diseases. Efforts should be devoted to developing new drugs that overcome NRTIs side effects and retain the anti-inflammaging properties of the parent drugs."

        "Title":"Predicting fracture toughness of human cortical bone from donors with and without type 2 diabetes using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning.",
        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased skeletal fragility, yet standard clinical assessments often fail to detect diabetes-induced changes in bone quality. Raman spectroscopy (RS), a label-free and non-destructive technique, offers insight into bone composition, and its full spectral profile may reveal changes not captured by traditional compositional metrics. Prior to propagating a crack from a micro-notch to failure, we acquired RS data from human cortical bone samples extracted from fresh-frozen, cadaveric femurs: 60 non-diabetic donors and 60 T2DM donors (equal number of females and males between 50\u00a0years and 97\u00a0years of age). Eight ML models, including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), ridge regression (RR), partial least squares (PLS), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting machine (GBM), Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), and Stacking, were evaluated for their ability to predict fracture toughness properties from the RS data. Using full-spectrum input, stacking regression yielded the best performance for predicting both crack initiation toughness (R<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.81, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.08) and the final J-integral or energy required to propagate crack to failure (R<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.86, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.14). These findings demonstrate that full-spectrum RS combined with ML can capture subtle, functionally relevant alterations in bone composition, enabling prediction of mechanical properties that are otherwise inaccessible. This is the first study to apply RS and ML for fracture toughness prediction in the context of T2DM, demonstrating the potential of spectroscopic approaches to improve assessment of bone quality in metabolic disease."

        "Title":"Digital Health Literacy in Patients With Common Chronic Diseases: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
        "Abstract":"Digital health technology (DHT) plays an increasingly vital role in managing chronic diseases by enabling patients to actively manage their health. These tools have been shown to improve self-management and adherence to medical advice. However, for DHT to be fully effective, patients with chronic conditions must be digitally literate. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), an 8\u2011item tool with scores ranging from 8 to 40, was developed to assess individuals' perceived ability to find, evaluate, and apply digital health information. Assessing patients' digital health literacy (DHL) and understanding the factors influencing it are essential for improving the accessibility and usability of health resources. This study aimed to assess DHL in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through a systematic review and meta\u2011analysis using eHEALS. We sought to determine average DHL scores, examine demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing DHL, and explore its impact on disease management to inform future strategies for enhancing DHL and improving chronic disease outcomes. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review across 7 databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, ERIC, CINAHL, Library Literature and Information Science Index, and Google Scholar) from inception to August 14, 2022, with an updated search in October 2024. Eligible studies included adults (\u226518 years) with DM, hypertension, or RA who reported DHL data using eHEALS (8-40) and were original research published in English. Exclusion criteria included studies involving participants younger than 18 years, reviews, meta\u2011analyses, studies not addressing the target diseases, or non\u2011English publications. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle\u2011Ottawa Scale (NOS). Eight studies involving 2527 participants were included. The pooled mean eHEALS score was 27.03 (95% CI 25.08-28.98), indicating high overall DHL. Stratified by disease, scores were higher for DM (27.79) and hypertension (28.48) but lower for RA (24.74). Quality assessment indicated a high standard of included studies. Factors influencing DHL included age, education, employment, and perception of the internet as a health resource. Due to the limited number of studies, meta\u2011regression analysis could not be performed. DHL is critical for individuals with chronic conditions, empowering them to make informed decisions and manage their health effectively. However, the scarcity of studies limits comprehensive analysis of DHL determinants. While the internet offers abundant health information, unequal DHL and health skills remain barriers. More inclusive research is needed to fully understand DHL's impact on health outcomes and mitigate disparities, ensuring equitable access to digital health resources and improving disease management."

        "Abstract":"Several studies have used electronic health records (EHRs) to build machine learning models predicting the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) later in pregnancy, but none have described validation of the GDM \"label\" within the EHRs. This study examines the accuracy of GDM diagnoses in EHRs compared with a clinical team database (CTD) and their impact on machine learning models. EHRs from 2018 to 2022 were validated against CTD data to identify true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). Logistic regression models were trained and tested using both EHR and validated labels, whereafter simulated label noise was introduced to increase FP and FN rates. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and average precision (AP). Among 3952 patients, 3388 (85.7%) were correctly identified with GDM in both databases, while 564 cases lacked a GDM label in EHRs, and 771 were missing a corresponding CTD label. Overall, 32,928 (87.5%) of cases were TN, 3388 (9%) TP, 771 (2%) FP, and 564 (1.5%) FN. The model trained and tested with validated labels achieved an ROC AUC of 0.817 and an AP of 0.450, whereas the same model tested using EHR labels achieved 0.814 and 0.395, respectively. Increased label noise during training led to gradual declines in ROC AUC and AP, while noise in the test set, especially elevated FP rates, resulted in marked performance drops. Discrepancies between EHR and CTD diagnoses had a limited impact on model training but significantly affected performance evaluation when present in the test set, emphasizing the importance of accurate data validation."

        "Abstract":"Mesenteric cysts are rare intra-abdominal lesions, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 100\u00a0000 to 1 in 250\u00a0000 adults. Clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to severe. Chylous mesenteric cysts caused by thoracic duct obstruction are particularly rare and have not been previously reported in obese adolescents. We report the case of a 19-year-old female patient with a rare asymptomatic chylous mesenteric cyst caused by thoracic duct obstruction, which was incidentally discovered during pre-operative evaluation for bariatric surgery. The patient underwent thoracic duct decompression and a personalized low-fat nutrition plan was implemented to mitigate postoperative chyle reflux and address concurrent obesity. Mesenteric cysts can have variable clinical presentations and their evaluation relies on a range of imaging modalities. Our case highlights the importance of lymphatic system evaluation in the diagnosis and management of mesenteric cysts, particularly chylous cysts. Surgery targeting lymphatic system abnormalities offers a targeted and less invasive treatment strategy than the traditional surgical resection. This case report emphasizes the importance of imaging evaluation of the lymphatic system for the diagnosis and management of mesenteric cysts. A treatment strategy that combines surgery targeting lymphatic system abnormalities with a personalized nutritional plan can provide a novel and less invasive alternative to traditional surgical resection of chylous mesenteric cysts, addressing the underlying etiology while minimizing surgical trauma and potential complications."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive condition often necessitating insulin therapy for sustained glycemic control, yet adherence to daily injections remains a significant challenge. While insulin glargine is effective, reducing injection frequency may improve compliance and outcomes. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec compared to once-daily insulin glargine U100. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search across multiple databases identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-weekly insulin icodec with once-daily insulin glargine U100 in adults with T2DM. Eligible studies included adult participants and reported glycemic or safety outcomes. Data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed via the I<sup>2<\/sup> statistic. Five RCTs comprising 2,019 participants met the inclusion criteria. Insulin icodec significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin (MD:\u00a0-0.12; 95% CI:\u00a0-0.20,\u00a0-0.04; <i>P<\/i> =\u00a00.003) and increased time in range (TIR; MD: 4.23; 95% CI: 2.20, 6.26; <i>P<\/i> < 0.0001) compared to insulin glargine. A modest increase in body weight was observed with insulin icodec, while safety profiles, including hypoglycemia rates and adverse events, were comparable between treatments. Insulin icodec provides a safe and effective alternative to once-daily insulin glargine for T2DM management, offering similar glycemic control with a once-weekly dosing regimen. The reduced injection burden may enhance adherence and treatment satisfaction, potentially improving long-term disease outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Early coronary angiography (CAG) is a subject of controversy in post-cardiac arrest patients who do not exhibit ST-segment elevation. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect it had on outcomes. A comprehensive search of Medline and Cochrane yielded 16 studies [of which 9 were observational and 7 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs)] involving 4737 patients. 95% confidence intervals accompanied odds ratios (ORs) were generated by a random-effects model. Meta-regression explored factors modifying effect sizes. Early coronary angiography (CAG) decreased long-term mortality significantly [OR: 0.66 (0.51-0.85)], improved favorable coronary prothrombotic scores [Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2] at discharge [OR: 1.49 (1.09-2.03)], and suggested a trend toward increased percutaneous coronary intervention after CAG [OR: 1.07 (0.75-1.53)]. In contrast to the RCT subgroup, the observational study subgroup exhibited reduced rates of short- and long-term mortality, as well as CPC1-2 at discharge. Meta-regression revealed that type 2 diabetes mellitus and follow-up time influence short-term mortality and CPC 1-2 at discharge, respectively. Observational studies demonstrated that early CAG in post-cardiac arrest patients without ST elevation is associated with long-term clinical benefits. Caveat should be exercised when interpreting."

Among 369 subjects who received 3 months of SIM01, a gut microbiota-derived synbiotic formula of three Bifidobacterium strains (B. adolescentis, B. bididum, and B. longum) or a placebo after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or the inactivated vaccine Sinovac-CoronaVac), we performed metagenomic sequencing in stool samples of 280 vaccinees collected at baseline and 3-month postvaccination and metabonomic sequencing in 276 vaccinees collected at baseline and 1-month postvaccination. The open niche of autochthonous gut microbiota (lower levels of Bifidobacterium and decreased functional potential for carbohydrate metabolism) was associated with enhancing SIM01-contained species. The enrichment of three bifidobacterial species after 3 months of SIM01 intervention (BABBBL_fc) was positively correlated with the level of neutralizing antibodies to the BNT162b2 vaccine at 6-month postvaccination. The fold change of benzoic acid was positively correlated with BABBBL_fc in the BNT162b2 vaccinees, which was also implicated with SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT)% levels at 1-month postvaccination. Importantly, SIM01 strain engraftment assessed by StrainPhlAn (A metagenomic strain-level population genomics tool) was associated with a higher fold change of three bifidobacterial species and could be predicted based on the baseline gut microbiome. Therefore, the resident gut microbiome affected the SIM01 engraftment, which was associated with the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccines."

        "Abstract":"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a rapidly increasing global health and healthcare challenge. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in kidney disease due to their role in apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. The aim of this study was to determine the role of miRNA-21-5p, miRNA-126-3p, and miRNA-192-5p in the prognosis of ESRD. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the discriminatory ability of these miRNAs as biomarkers for ESRD in relation to the comorbidities of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM). One hundred and ten individuals were recruited for our study and divided into three groups: group 1 included 40 ESRD patients with hypertension, group 2 included 40 ESRD patients with diabetes, and group 3 (n\u2009=\u200930) served as healthy controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify the above miRNAs. Patients with ESRD were found to have lower levels of miRNA-126-3p and higher levels of miRNAs-21-5p and -\u2009192-5p. Furthermore, the accuracies of ROC analyses for miR-21-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-192-5p were 96.65%, 99.5%, and 93.35% in ESRD with HTN and 95%, 71.5%, and 93% in ESRD with DM. Dysregulation of these miRNAs is associated with the development of ESRD and could be used as biomarkers for ESRD. This study briefly outlines the challenges associated with miRNA research and the potential use of miRNA molecules in the management of ESRD, proposing a research approach emphasizing the development of standardized and reliable biomarkers for therapeutic use. Despite the promising diagnostic utility demonstrated, the lack of cross-validation and external validation remains an important limitation. Future large-scale, independent studies are essential to confirm these findings and ensure broader applicability."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes is considered to be a risk factor for colon cancer (CC), and CC patients with diabetes tend to have a worse prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism of this condition remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between diabetes and CC further, and to find effective therapeutic targets. Transcription and clinical information data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, accessed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different groups, and enriched function and pathway by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. We conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to obtain significant modules and hub genes of diabetic-related CC. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and Kaplan-Meier plotter were performed to diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Using the Connectivity Map (CMap) database to predict small molecule compounds, and employed molecular docking to simulate the binding conformation of the potential agent and key targets. Moreover, CIBERSORT was used to depict the immune infiltration in diabetic-related CC. The correlations between tumor mutation burden score, microsatellite instability score, and hub DEGs expression were performed by Spearman's correlation. In this study, 633 DEGs were identified from the tumor (n\u2009=\u200942) and the normal colon mucosa samples (n\u2009=\u200942), and 133 DEGs were identified from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n\u2009=\u200946) and non-T2DM samples (n\u2009=\u200938). We obtained a gene module including 1183 genes significantly related to CC patients with diabetes, and finally, the intersection of tumor-associated DEGs, diabetes-associated DEGs, and WGCNA identified 11 hub DEGs. The hub DEGs had great diagnostic and prognostic values for CC and diabetes. We found the small-molecule compound NVP-BEZ235 according to its high binding affinity to the targets and exhibited the molecular docking landscape including CDC42BPA, COX6A1, PON2, TM9SF2, UBBE2K, UBR2, ZC3H14, and ZNF106. In addition, we found the immune-infiltrating differences between CC patients with diabetes and those without diabetes. The expression of hub DEGs was significantly correlated with tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability. Diabetes plays an important role in CC pathogenesis, and NVP-BEZ235 may be a promising therapeutic drug for CC patients with diabetes."

The diabetic mouse model was established and treated with CO-releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) or invalid CORM-2 (iCORM-2). For in vitro studies, cardiomyocytes were treated with high glucose (HG). The HG-treated cardiomyocytes exhibited increased IL-33, ST2L, and pyroptosis-related protein expression compared with that in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Treatment with recombinant IL-33 further increased the expression of HG-induced pyroptosis-related proteins (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with control mice, DCM mice showed reduced cardiac function and elevated expression of IL-33, ST2L, and pyroptosis-related proteins (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Intervention with CORM-2 ameliorated cardiac injury, and decreased the expression of IL-33, ST2L, and pyroptosis-related proteins in vivo and in vitro (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, iCORM-2 had no effect both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, CO may inhibit cardiomyocyte pyroptosis by downregulating the IL-33\/ST2L axis in DCM mice."

We entered participant-level risk factor values over time into a validated type 2 diabetes-specific clinical outcomes model to estimate event rates, and compared simulated with observed relative risk changes in EXSCEL. We performed simulations for each participant to minimize uncertainty and to optimize confidence interval precision around risk point estimates. Six outcomes were examined: major adverse CV event (MACE), all-cause mortality (ACM), CV death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). We also performed a mediation analysis using Cox regression models to evaluate potential key mediators for ACM. Model simulations explained only modest proportions of the observed relative risk reductions for MACE (29%), ACM (15%), CV death (18%), and stroke (29%), but greater proportions for hHF (67%) and MI (200%). Mediation analysis suggested that baseline-to-6 or 12-month changes in HbA<sub>1c<\/sub>, blood pressure, heart rate, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and weight did not mediate the EQW effect on ACM. These model simulations explain only a modest proportion of the impact of observed EQW-induced changes in conventional CV risk factors on EXSCEL outcomes, apart from hHF and MI. Up to 1-year changes in conventional risk factors did not mediate the observed ACM risk reduction."

In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the foot and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single-cell sequencing data from GEO database. Our analysis revealed that RBP genes were abnormally expressed in DFUs, highly cell population-specific, and can be used as signature genes for different cell clusters. Co-expression and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses showed that differentially expressed RBP genes were highly related to the wound healing process. Genes encoding heat shock proteins were associated with 'healing-related' fibroblast differentiation. Western blotting of wound tissues from normal control and diabetic patients were performed, confirming the significant upregulation of HSP90 and downregulation of ZFP36. Analysis of the combined foot samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples revealed common differentially expressed RBP genes, indicating consistency between foot and blood samples. Our results demonstrate the important roles of RBP in the healing process of chronic diabetic wounds, provide clues for further research on RBP regulatory mechanisms in certain cell types, and help develop novel therapeutic treatments for DFUs."

        "Abstract":"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Hepatic lipotoxicity and inflammation are two key factors driving progression of steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The presence of MASH increases the risk of cardiovascular events, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-liver malignancies. Although MASLD and lipid species have been extensively examined in persons with type 2 diabetes, much less is known in type 1 diabetes. We examined the association of key lipid species with MASLD in individuals with type 1 diabetes. We designed a cross-sectional study of 30 participants with type 1 diabetes recr1uited from our institutional diabetes clinics. All participants had fasting blood drawn for targeted lipidomics and underwent a FibroScan. Those with steatosis score of\u2009\u2265\u2009248 as determined by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) were categorized as cases (n\u2009=\u200917); those with steatosis score\u2009<\u2009248 were categorized as controls (n\u2009=\u200913). BMI was significantly higher in cases than controls (P\u2009=\u20090.0007) and used significantly higher 24-h insulin doses than controls (P\u2009=\u20090.004). Cases displayed significantly higher circulating levels of total ceramides (P\u2009=\u20090.02), diacylglycerols (P\u2009=\u20090.0009) and triacylglycerols (P\u2009=\u20090.0004). The two groups displayed similar levels of hexosylceramides, dihydrosphingomyelins, sphingomyelins, and phosphatidylcholines. Similar to previous findings, numerous sphingolipids species, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols were found to correlate positively with higher BMI and 24-h insulin dose. Total circulating dihydroceramides, ceramides, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols levels significantly correlated with steatosis score (P\u2009<\u20090.05). None of the lipid species correlated with fibrosis score. These results suggest that persons with type 1 diabetes and MASLD have a higher BMI, are likely to be insulin resistant, and display elevated circulating levels of dihydroceramides, ceramides, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols, which are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of steatotic liver disease."

Additional research has suggested that diabetic subjects treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists exhibit a reduced incidence of PD compared to those receiving other anti-diabetic medications. GLP-1 receptor agonists are FDA-approved therapies for T2DM, and recent studies have explored their potential as repurposed treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, AD, and ALS, as well as cerebrovascular disorders. This systematic review aims to assess the available literature on the efficacy and safety profiles of GLP-1 receptor agonists in PD management. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted to identify relevant studies. The primary outcomes of this review include motor impairment in PD, as assessed by MDS-UPDRS Part III, as well as motor complications (Part IV) and motor experiences of daily living (Part II), and the incidence of gastrointestinal and systemic side effects. Meta-analysis showed that GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly improved motor function, as reflected by MDS-UPDRS Part III scores in the ON state (mean difference\u2009=\u2009-\u20092.88; p\u2009=\u20090.01; I<sup>2<\/sup>\u2009=\u200930%), although they were associated with a higher incidence of adverse events across all safety outcomes.

However, direct mechanical insight is required to illustrate the contribution of intestinal microflora in the disease progression. In this study, we aimed to precisely assess the changes in intestinal bacteria translocation (IBT) from gut to the pancreas using combinations of FISH, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and deep learning-assisted methods to track IBT in diet-induced obese (DIO) and antibiotic-induced microbiota disruption (AIMD)-DIO mouse models. Our analysis showed deep learning-assisted quantification enhanced the accuracy and objectivity of bacterial tracking. The DIO mice exhibited increased IBT, likely due to excessive intestinal lipid accumulation and compromised intestinal barrier integrity. Elevated bacterial loads in the pancreas were associated with worsened pancreatic function, indicated by higher fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and dysfunctional insulin secretion. In contrast, the AIMD-DIO group lowered the IBT, maintained the islet structure and improved glucose homeostasis. Comparative study between DIO and AIMD-DIO models revealed a strong correlation between number of translocated bacteria and T2DM severity. These findings provide objective evidence of bacterial migration from the intestine to the pancreas and establishes its pathological relationship with pancreatic impairment and dysfunction and underscores to utilize AI techniques more successfully in the future for evaluating IBT."

        "Abstract":"The rising prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) highlights the need for effective self-care interventions. Despite strong evidence supporting their effectiveness, patient engagement, uptake, and integration into routine care remain limited. Co-design approaches can enhance the relevance and adoption of interventions but are underutilized in DFU management. This study outlines the development of Healing through Empowerment and Active Listening (HEALing), a self-care intervention for patients with DFU, grounded in Self-Determination Theory and Motivational Interviewing, and developed using an experience-based co-design approach. The 27-month co-design process consisted of three phases involving patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals(HCPs), and researchers from across primary care in Singapore. Phase 1 (16 months) included qualitative interviews with patients (N\u2009=\u200927), caregivers (N\u2009=\u20095), and HCPs\u00a0(N\u2009=\u20098), analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis, alongside a quantitative survey (N\u2009=\u2009186), analyzed using structural equation modelling to identify intervention determinants. Phase 2 (9 months) involved co-design workshops with patients (N\u2009=\u200910) and wound care nurses (N\u2009=\u20096) to define the intervention's content and delivery approach. In Phase 3 (2 months), iterative meetings refined the intervention's procedures, tools, and materials. Qualitative data from Phases 2 and 3 were thematically analyzed. Key barriers to DFU self-care included limited control over ulceration and treatment, low confidence, negative emotions, and misperceptions about the condition. Personalised care and clinician-facilitated motivation emerged as key enablers. HEALing targets five core self-care components: (1) wound care, (2) foot care and footwear, (3) diabetes care, (4) treatment seeking, and (5) managing worries and concerns. The personalised components are delivered using a card-sorting tool during clinic-integrated sessions by trained wound care nurses. The HEALing delivery pathway comprises three 30-min sessions at 2-week intervals. During workshops, participants perceived HEALing as supporting patient- and clinician-endorsed person-centred care and collaborative planning, while also identifying potential implementation challenges, including training needs and structural barriers. HEALing positions patients as experts by experience, addressing the psychological and behavioural complexities of DFU care. This nurse-led and stakeholder-endorsed intervention is currently undergoing feasibility evaluation. Individuals with DFUs, their caregivers, and those with post-healing in remission, and wound care nurses as service users contributed to co-design HEALing by identifying intervention targets and shaping the intervention's content and delivery."

        "Title":"Impact of postoperative complications and type 2 diabetes on breast cancer recurrence and mortality.",
        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with increased risk of complications after breast cancer surgery. This study investigated systemic and surgical-site postoperative complications and the risk of early and late breast cancer recurrence and mortality, overall, and according to T2D status. From the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) and Danish registries, a cohort of women with incident early-stage breast cancer diagnosed 1996-2017 was assembled. All women underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. Using diagnostic codes, systemic and surgical-site complications within 30\u2005days of surgery were defined. Early recurrence (<10\u2005years from diagnosis) was ascertained from the DBCG and late recurrence (\u226510\u2005years after diagnosis) via a validated registry-based algorithm. Incidence rates (IRs) per 1000 person-years were calculated, and Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of early and late recurrence, and death, according to postoperative complications. Potential effect measure modification by T2D was evaluated. Among 58 198 women undergoing breast cancer surgery, 6285 (10.8%) had postoperative complications. Overall, 747 and 5756 women with and without complications developed early recurrence (IR: 19.7 and 17.9, aHR = 1.04, 95% c.i. 0.96, 1.13), whereas 314 and 3314 women developed late recurrence (IR: 23.9 and 26.0, and aHR = 0.90, 95% c.i. 0.80, 1.02). Prevalent T2D did not impact these findings. Women with postoperative complications had higher mortality rates than those without complications (aHR = 1.11; 95% c.i. 1.06, 1.16); especially those with T2D versus no T2D (aHR = 1.50; 95% c.i. 1.30, 1.73). Postoperative complications after breast cancer primary surgery did not impact recurrence risk but had a negative impact on survival, especially in women with T2D."

        "Abstract":"The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) has emerged as a promising predictor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but population-specific patterns and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigated the association between AIP and T2DM risk in Chinese and Japanese populations, focusing on non-linear relationships, population-specific thresholds, and the mediating role of body mass index (BMI). We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the China Rich Healthcare Group (n\u2009=\u2009112,483) and the Japanese NAGALA database (n\u2009=\u200915,453). AIP was calculated as log10[triglyceride (TG)\/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)]. T2DM was defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG)\u2009\u2265\u20097.0 mmol\/L, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)\u2009\u2265\u20096.5%, or self-reported diabetes during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models with restricted cubic splines were used to examine non-linear relationships. Two-piecewise regression models identified population-specific thresholds, and formal mediation analyses quantified BMI's mediating effect. During a median follow-up of 3.0 years, 1,801 participants (1.41%) developed T2DM. AIP demonstrated a significant positive association with T2DM risk in both populations: hazard ratio (HR) per unit increase: Chinese 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-2.21; Japanese 2.42, 95% CI 1.67-3.52) after comprehensive adjustment. We identified distinct population-specific non-linear relationships with different threshold effects: in Chinese participants, T2DM risk increased significantly until AIP reached 0.436, while in Japanese participants, significant risk elevation began at AIP values exceeding -\u20090.449. BMI mediated a considerably higher proportion of the total effect in Chinese (39.84%) compared to Japanese participants (27.11%), indicating differential pathophysiological mechanisms. Our findings reveal substantial population-specific differences in the AIP-T2DM relationship, including population-specific thresholds and mediation pathways. These results underscore the importance of population-tailored screening strategies and suggest that interventions targeting lipid metabolism and BMI management may have varying efficacy across East Asian populations."

This study aims to examine whether air pollution levels modify the associations of PA with all-cause mortality and incident cancer, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 414,644 UK Biobank participants were included in the analyses. PA was self-reported and objectively measured using accelerometers. PA was self-reported with IPAQ and objectively measured using accelerometers. Annual PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>, PM<sub>10<\/sub>, and NO air pollutant concentrations in 2010 were measured using a European land use regression model. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the associations of PA and air pollution with health outcomes. Multiplicative and additive interactions were estimated. During the study period from 2006 to 2022, 31,765 (7.7%) died, 70,299 (17.0%) had incident cancer, 25,130 (8.5%) had type 2 diabetes, 33,284 (8.0%) had MACE, and 18,844 (4.5%) had COPD. Lower PA was associated with higher risk of all\u00a0health outcomes. Higher concentration of PM<sub>2.5<\/sub> was associated with all outcomes except for cancer. The associations of self-reported PA with mortality and cancer were stronger in areas with higher air pollution with significant additive and multiplicative interactions. There was no evidence of moderation for objectively measured PA. In the UK, air pollution should not be a factor inhibiting the promotion of PA."

        "Abstract":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are extensively used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. While these medications offer glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits, the risks have increased because of their potential impact on cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between GLP-1 RAs and CRC risk in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs. This study was conducted the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched from inception to December 2024. The inclusion criteria encompassed Studies analyzing the effects of GLP-1 RA on CRC risk in patients with T2DM. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for the quality assessment of the included cohort studies. Random-effects models were employed for the pooled analysis, and heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. Seven retrospective cohort studies involving 5,066,681 patients were included. The pooled analysis revealed a significantly increased risk of CRC among patients receiving GLP-1 RAs (RR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.82-2.93; I2\u2009=\u200936%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). However, the incidence of CRC was not significantly associated with GLP-1 RA use compared with other drugs (OR, 1.73; 95% CI: 0.21-14.18, p\u2009=\u20090.61; I2\u2009=\u2009100%). Quality assessment indicated a low-to-moderate risk of bias across the included studies. Overall, this study suggests a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with GLP-1 RA use in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs. However, the incidence of CRC is not considerably high. These findings highlight the need for further long-term, large-scale clinical trials to elucidate the relationship between GLP-1 RAs and cancer risk. Clinicians should consider these results when prescribing GLP-1 RAs, particularly in patients with CRC risk factors."

        "Abstract":"Lipid metabolism-related inflammatory indices (LMIIs) have been recognized as potential biomarkers for the risks of atherosclerosis and major adverse cardiovascular events. This study aims to explore the associations of LMIIs, including neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR), monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR), platelet to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR), and lymphocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (LHR), with the risk of incident peripheral artery disease (PAD) in elderly T2DM patients. A total of 2837 participants aged\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years with T2DM from the Jinshan Cohort (China) and 13,542 participants from the UK Biobank (UK) were included in the primary analyses. According to the type of outcome variables, logistic regression models and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the risks of incident PAD associated with LMIIs. The methods of generalized propensity score (GPS), E-value and negative control exposure (NCE) were applied to control the potential confounding. Additionally, stratified analyses were performed across various populations to examine potential heterogeneity in the effects of LMIIs on PAD risk. Mediation effects of liver and kidney function-related indicators on associations between LMIIs and incident PAD were also explored. The results from traditional regression models suggested positive associations of incident PAD with all four LMIIs. In the Jinshan Cohort, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PAD for one-unit increase in NHR (10<sup>9<\/sup>\u00a0mmol), MHR (10<sup>8<\/sup>\u00a0mmol), PHR (10<sup>11<\/sup>\u00a0mmol) and LHR (10<sup>9<\/sup>\u00a0mmol) were 1.24 (1.11-1.39), 1.22 (1.08-1.37), 1.69 (1.32-2.15) and 1.57 (1.22-2.01), respectively. While in the UK Biobank, the corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%CI were 1.14 (1.10-1.18), 1.03 (1.01-1.04), 1.19 (1.09-1.29) and 1.11 (1.07-1.14), respectively, These associations remained robust in regression models weighted by GPS methods. The E-values for the effects of each LMII on PAD were consistently found to be significantly larger than their corresponding observed effects in both cohorts. NCE analyses revealed no statistically significant associations between any selected NCE and PAD in either cohort. On calibration using NCEs, the calibrated P values confirmed significant effect sizes for associations between LMIIs and incident PAD (all for P\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, subgroup analyses in the Jinshan Cohort showed different associations varied across sex, residential area, smoking status and HbA1c level, with pronounced HRs in females, urban residents, smokers and individuals with HbA1c\u2009\u2265\u20097%. Findings from the UK Biobank further suggested that aspirin use and HbA1c level may modify the effects of LMIIs on PAD risk (P-interaction\u2009<\u20090.05). Mediation analyses indicated that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) mediated the relationships between LMIIs and PAD. The proportion of the mediating effects ranged from 10.03% to 19.95% in the Jinshan Cohort and from 10.20 to 20.80% in the UK Biobank. Elevated levels of LMIIs, such as NHR, MHR, PHR and LHR, were associated with an increased risk of incident PAD among elderly diabetic patients. These associations exhibited notable population heterogeneity, with stronger effects observed in females and individuals with higher HbA1c level. eGFR may serve as a mediating factor in the associations between LMIIs and the occurrence of PAD. These findings provide novel evidence for immune inflammation-based risk assessment and personalized preventive strategies for PAD."

This study investigated the prevalence of metabolic co-morbidities in adults with malaria and whether type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (Met-S) affect the severity of malaria in adults living in a malaria-endemic setting. We conducted a cross-sectional study with prospective inclusion of patients at two tertiary-level public hospitals in Bafoussam and Dschang (West Region, Cameroon). Adults (\u2265\u200921\u00a0years) diagnosed with malaria were included. Malaria severity was determined following the WHO criteria. All patients were assessed for diabetes, obesity, and Met-S, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Additional host factors investigated included age, sex, HIV infection, sickle cell trait and blood group. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess potential associations with severe malaria. Among 289 adults diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria, 120 (41.6%) fulfilled at least one criterion for severe malaria. Diabetes was found in 26\/120 (21.7%) of patients with severe and 10\/169 (6.0%) with non-severe malaria (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Met-S was diagnosed in 39\/120 (32.5%) severe and 27\/166 (16.3%) non-severe cases, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Obesity was similarly detected in severe (23\/103; 22.3%) and non-severe cases (34\/148; 23.0%). In multivariable analyses, diabetes (aOR\u2009=\u20093.24; 95%CI, 1.38-7.62) and Met-S (aOR\u2009=\u20093.18; 95%CI, 1.60-6.37) were independently associated with severe malaria. A high prevalence of diabetes and metabolic comorbidities was found among adults diagnosed with malaria in hospital settings in an endemic area. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome, but not obesity alone, were identified as risk factors for severe malaria. Investigation for diabetes should be considered in adults with severe malaria."

However, the absence of evidence for a direct causal relationship between them limits the development of effective treatment strategies. This study aimed to explore the association between Mets and OAB in the U.S. population and elucidate their causal relationships. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the 2005-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). OAB symptoms were assessed using the OAB symptom score (OABSS), and Mets was diagnosed based on the NCEP-ATP III criteria. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between Mets and OAB. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed to assess the consistency of this association. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate the causal effects of Mets components or risk factors on OAB symptoms, including bladder calcification \/contracture\/ overactivity (BCCO) and urinary frequency\/incontinence (UFI). The cross-sectional study involved 7,596 participants. After adjusting for covariates, individuals with Mets had a significantly higher risk of OAB (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.89-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.035). Gender subgroup analysis revealed that females had 51% higher odds of developing OAB compared to the reference group (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.13-2.02, p\u2009=\u20090.008), while this association was not observed in males (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.63-1.43, p\u2009>\u20090.05). MR analysis found no significant causal relationship between Mets and OAB symptoms; however, certain Mets components or risk factors, including BMI, waist circumference (WC), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and hypertension, were associated with an increased risk of OAB. The sensitivity analysis excluded the influence of potential heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. This study highlighted a positive association between Mets and OAB in the U.S. population, with significant gender differences. Furthermore, it provided evidence suggesting a potential causal role of Mets components in the development of OAB and highlighted the importance of therapeutic strategies targeting Mets for managing OAB symptoms."

However, challenges remain in identifying naturally derived, multifunctional active substances capable of addressing the complex pathophysiology of wounds, as well as in tailoring hydrogels to enhance their suitability for wound applications. Here, we present a novel biological hydrogel microcarrier system by integrating Bletilla striata-derived nanoparticles (PdNPs) and polydopamine nanozymes (PDAs) into a hyaluronic acid-methacrylate (HAMA) hydrogel. PdNPs can polarize over-activated macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and restore fibroblast functionality. Meanwhile, PDAs act as potent reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and protect fibroblasts from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. When encapsulated into HAMA microcarriers, the PdNP\u2009+\u2009PDA@HAMA microcarriers significantly accelerate wound healing in a diabetic rat model. These outcomes demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our natural, multifunctional hydrogel microcarriers as a promising wound dressing platform for the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds."

NCDs are both a health burden and an economic burden, but many can be prevented by public health interventions that include screening and treatment. The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of NCDs pre-diabetes, suspected diabetes, hypertension and high total cholesterol (TC)\/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, as well as the prevalence of high cardiovascular risk (CVR) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The secondary objective was to assess modifiable risk factors for NCDs and investigate correlations between these risk factors and age, sex and emirate of residence. A health screening programme (HSP) for the early detection and treatment of NCDs was launched in 2021 to screen, diagnose and treat NCDs. This retrospective cross-sectional study analysed HSP data collected from April 2021 to December 2023. Primary healthcare centres in the UAE. 34\u2009290 participants in the HSP who were screened for the first time. Of the participants, 60.4% were female, and 51.8% were 18-39\u2009years old. Pre-diabetes was found in 17.3% (95% CI, 16.9% to 17.7%), suspected diabetes type 2 in 6.1% (95% CI, 5.8 to 6.3), hypertension in 13.9% (95% CI, 13.5% to 14.3%), and high TC\/HDL ratio in 8.1% (95% CI, 7.8% to 8.4%). A high CVR was found in 11.5% (95% CI, 11.1% to 11.8%) of overall participants and 52.5% (95% CI, 50.5% to 54.5%) of people with diabetes. The OR of high CVR was 11.95 for suspected diabetics. Modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, were all associated with age and sex; in addition, age and sex interacted in their effect on these factors. The prevalence of the four NCDs and high CVR was high in the northern emirates. High CVR was especially common among people with diabetes. A large majority of participants had one or more modifiable risk factors. Age, sex and their interaction correlated strongly with the modifiable risk factors. These results can guide the introduction of specialised preventive and curative services to enhance public health and well-being."

The present study used uricase-deficient rats (KDY rats, n\u2009=\u2009125) with spontaneously elevated levels of serum uric acid (SUA) as the model animals and investigated their metabolic conditions throughout their lifespan (626 days of age). The serum, urine and feces of the rats were collected, histological examination was performed using hematoxylin-eosin or Masson's staining, and gene expression was determined using transcriptome high-throughput sequencing. Compared with wild type (WT) rats of the same age, the SUA levels in KDY rats were continuously high (approximately 70 \u03bcg\/mL), and the body weight gain slowed after 45 days of age, followed by increased urine output, diabetes mellitus (hyperglycemia), high low-density lipoprotein, and hypercholesterolemia. Histological examination showed that gouty nephropathy appeared after approximately 45 days of age, before the rats developed medullary injury, medullary interstitial fibrosis, cortical glomerulus injury, and glomerular fibrosis. KDY rats also showed signs of atherosclerosis and hypertension in the late stage of their lifespan. The lifespan of KDY rats was significantly shorter than that of WT rats (more than 626 days). The expected lifespan of KDY rats is approximately 450 days, and the direct cause of the shortened lifespan is renal failure caused by gout nephropathy. The direct mechanisms of the lesions in KDY are related to the upregulation of various of inflammatory (immune) pathways. In conclusion, it demonstrated that hyperuricemia in KDY rats leads to type 2 diabetes mellitus (hyperglycemia), hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and hypertension, in addition to gouty nephropathy."

In this study, we evaluated the effects of the diabetes P4P program on QoL among all patients as well as the effects of this program on QoL among patients with comorbid gastrointestinal conditions. Data were collected across 6 hospitals. We used the five-level version of the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) to obtain scores for health disutility. The scores for these measures were subsequently predicted via a generalized linear model (GLM) with a gamma distribution. We also applied propensity score weighting (PSW) to adjust for potential selection bias. After PSW, P4P program participation was found to be significantly correlated with lower EQ-5D disutility scores among all patients (parameter\u2009=\u2009-0.169, [-0.325, -0.012], P\u2009=\u20090.034).

Our findings suggest that participation in the diabetes P4P program is associated with improved HRQoL among all patients with type 2 diabetes, including those with gastrointestinal comorbidities. A P4P model incorporating continuing education, coordinated care, and regular follow-up may be particularly beneficial in enhancing HRQoL for patients with gastrointestinal complications."

Despite improvements in healthcare, disparities in CeVD-related mortality among diabetic populations in the United States persist. We conducted a retrospective analysis using the CDC WONDER database from 1999 to 2020 to assess mortality trends related to CeVD among adults aged \u2265\u200945\u2009years with DM. Deaths were identified using ICD-10 codes I60-I69 (CeVD) and E10-E14 (DM). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) were calculated, and trends were analysed using Joinpoint regression, stratified by age, race\/ethnicity, geography, urbanisation, and place of death. A total of 689,846 CeVD-related deaths occurred in diabetic individuals. AAMR decreased from 36.9 in 1999 to 29.3 in 2020, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of -1.41%. However, a sharp rise was observed from 2018 to 2020 (APC 14.87%), indicating a concerning reversal in progress. The highest crude mortality rates were in the 75-84 age group, and the lowest in the 45-54 group. Black and Hispanic populations, rural residents, and those in the Southern United States had the highest mortality rates. The Northeast and Asian populations had the lowest, reflecting persistent disparities in access to care and preventive services. While CeVD mortality in diabetics declined over two decades, the recent reversal highlights emerging challenges, possibly due to healthcare disruptions and socioeconomic disparities. These findings underscore the need for targeted public health interventions to address inequities and improve outcomes in high-risk populations."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) exacerbates the risk of IONs through chronic hyperglycemia and associated vascular dysfunction. Recently, semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has been linked to ocular complications, including non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), potentially due to the rapid glycemic changes or vascular effects. <b>Case Presentation<\/b>: A 55-year-old female with type 2 DM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented with blurred vision and optic disc edema after four months of semaglutide therapy (Ozempic<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, Sydney, Australia). Initially diagnosed with diabetic papillopathy (DP), her condition progressed to NAION, leading to partial visual recovery with corticosteroid treatment and improved glycemic management. Diagnostic evaluations, including visual field testing, optical coherence tomography, and fluorescein angiography, supported the diagnosis. <b>Conclusions<\/b>: This case report describes the clinical course of a diabetic patient treated with a semaglutide who developed an ischemic optic event. The timing of symptom onset in relation to the initiation of semaglutide therapy raises the possibility of a causal association between the drug and this rare ocular complication.

Initial respiratory polygraphy revealed severe sleep-disordered breathing with dominant CSA-CSB and moderate OSA. Laboratory investigations also revealed severe iron-deficiency anemia, which was managed with parenteral iron supplementation. The patient underwent CPAP titration, which led to modest improvement and residual high apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).

Antithrombotic medications are administered as prophylactic treatment in patients with a risk of stroke. The aim of this study was to determine outcome measures in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke and AF regarding prior antithrombotic therapy. <b>Methods<\/b>: We collected data on stroke risk factors, CHADS<sub>2<\/sub> score, and international normalized ratio (INR) value in the context of warfarin therapy, as well as data related to localization, stroke severity, and functional outcome at discharge. <b>Results<\/b>: A total of 754 subjects with first-ever ischemic stroke and AF were included in this cross-sectional study (122 on warfarin, 210 on acetylsalicylic acid, and 422 without prior antithrombotic therapy). The diagnosis of AF was previously unknown in 31% of the subjects. Stroke risk factors (arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy) were significantly lower in the group without prior antithrombotic therapy. The anticoagulant group was significantly younger (<i>p<\/i> = 0.001). Overall, 45.4% of subjects with a previously known AF event and a high risk of developing stroke received anticoagulant therapy. Participants on warfarin had a significantly better functional outcome than those on antiplatelet therapy or without prior antithrombotic therapy (median mRS 4 vs. 5 vs. 5; <i>p<\/i> = 0.025) and lower NIHSS scores, although the difference was not statistically significant (median 10 vs. 12 vs. 12; <i>p<\/i> = 0.09). There was no difference between stroke localization among groups (<i>p<\/i> = 0.116). <b>Conclusions<\/b>: Our study showed that, in our cohort, first-ever ischemic stroke due to AF was more common in women. Subjects on prior anticoagulant therapy had more favorable outcomes at discharge."

SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which may impair liver function and promote glucose intolerance. This study investigated the role of SARS-CoV-2, specifically its Main Protease (M<sup>pro<\/sup>), in accelerating insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in HepG2 cells in vitro. <b>Methods:<\/b> HepG2 cells were treated with varying concentrations of M<sup>pro<\/sup> (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nmol\/mL) for 24 h to assess cytotoxicity and glucose uptake. Based on initial findings, subsequent assays focused on higher concentrations (40, 80, and 160 nmol\/mL). The effects of M<sup>pro<\/sup> on cell viability, protein kinase B (AKT) expression, matrix metallopeptidase-1 (MMP1), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and lipid peroxidation were investigated. <b>Results:<\/b> Our findings reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro<\/sup> treatment led to a concentration-dependent reduction in glucose uptake in HepG2 cells. Additionally, the M<sup>pro<\/sup> treatment was associated with reduced insulin-stimulated AKT activation, particularly at higher concentrations. Inflammatory markers such as IL-6 were elevated in the extracellular medium, while DPP4 expression was decreased. However, extracellular soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) levels did not show a significant change. Despite these changes, cell viability remained relatively unaffected, suggesting that the HepG2 cells were able to maintain overall metabolic functions under M<sup>pro<\/sup> exposure. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study demonstrated the concentration-dependent impairment of hepatic glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammatory pathways in HepG2 cells acutely exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro<\/sup>. These findings warrant further investigation to explore the long-term metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its proteases in the liver and to develop potential therapeutic approaches for post-viral metabolic complications."

        "Abstract":"<b>Background\/Objectives<\/b>: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) complicates approximately 14% of pregnancies worldwide, its prevalence rising with increasing maternal age and obesity. While maternal hyperglycemia is traditionally associated with fetal overgrowth and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) neonates, emerging evidence indicates that GDM may also contribute to small-for-gestational-age (SGA) outcomes. <b>Methods<\/b>: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, to identify studies related to gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal growth outcomes such as small for gestational age and large for gestational age, and associated pathophysiological mechanisms. <b>Results<\/b>: This narrative review explores the mechanisms by which GDM influences fetal growth, emphasizing the dual risk of excessive and restricted intrauterine growth. Fetal macrosomia typically results from chronic maternal hyperglycemia, leading to increased transplacental glucose delivery and fetal hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, SGA outcomes are a consequence of vascular and endothelial dysfunction, placental insufficiency, or excessively restrictive glycemic control that limit the availability of nutrients. Both extremes of fetal growth carry a myriad of significant perinatal and long-term metabolic risks. <b>Conclusions<\/b>: Understanding the diverse pathways through which GDM affects fetal growth is essential for developing individualized clinical strategies."

        "Abstract":"Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors exert synergistic immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. Moreover, intervention studies showed that combination therapy based on the concomitant use of vitamin D and DPP-4 inhibitors (VIDPP-4i) may preserve beta-cell function in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). These effects are particularly relevant in the context of beta-cell replacement strategies, whose long-term efficacy can be hampered by various factors, such as immune-mediated graft rejection, inadequate vascularization, hypoxia, trauma-induced cell apoptosis, fibrosis, host immune response, and recurrence of autoimmunity. Based on preclinical and clinical studies conducted in the fields of autoimmune diabetes and solid organ\/cell transplantation, the present narrative review aims to describe the rationale behind the investigation of VIDPP-4i combination therapy as an adjuvant treatment strategy to enhance the efficacy of novel beta-cell replacement therapies for T1D. In this regard, we discuss the potential immune and metabolic mechanisms through which vitamin D and DPP-4 inhibitors can promote the long-term function and survival of transplanted islets in patients with T1D receiving various types of beta-cell replacement therapies, including therapeutic approaches using encapsulated stem cell-derived beta cells."

        "Abstract":"In this study, we aimed to quantify the magnitude of educational and economic disparities and examine risk factors associated with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in Cambodia. We used data from the 2023 STEPwise approach to noncommunicable risk factor surveillance to analyse 3660 participants aged 18-69 years. We quantified the extent of disparities using the regression-based slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII). We used multi-level modified Poisson regression models to identify the potential risk factors. Overall, the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose was 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20095.6, 7.3) and 4.4% (95% CI\u2009=\u20093.6, 5.3). The magnitude of educational inequality in the prevalence of diabetes was significant, with the disease more concentrated among the non-educated population (SII\u2009=\u2009-7.6; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-12.0, -3.3). Economic inequality in diabetes prevalence was less pronounced than education-based inequality at the national level (SII\u2009=\u2009-0.7; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-4.5, 3.0); however, rural areas showed a concentration of diabetes among economically disadvantaged groups (SII\u2009=\u2009-4.7; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-9.1, -0.3). Key factors associated with diabetes were advanced age \u226540 years, overweight (prevalence ratio (PR)\u2009=\u20091.4; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.0, 2.0), obesity (PR\u2009=\u20091.7; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.1, 2.5), comorbid hypertension (PR\u2009=\u20092.4; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.8, 3.1), and daily alcohol consumption (PR\u2009=\u20092.0; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.2, 3.3). Daily sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (PR\u2009=\u20091.8; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.1, 3.1) also showed an increased risk of undiagnosed diabetes. The significant educational and economic disparities underscore the need for targeted interventions aimed at supporting non-educated and economically poor populations. Strengthening public health measures to address key risk factors, particularly alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, is essential to curbing the growing burden of diabetes in Cambodia."

        "Abstract":"Regulated kidney function is dependent on maintaining efficient energy utilization. Our aim in this study was to determine the effects of acute, ambient hyperglycemia and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition on plasma amino acid metabolism in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The ATIRMA trial, a single-arm study, evaluated the effects of 8\u2009weeks of oral empagliflozin (25\u2009mg\/day) in 40 young adults with T1D. The study involved consecutive two-day assessments of clamped euglycemia and hyperglycemia at both baseline and post-treatment. MetaboAnalyst 6.0 categorized 35 metabolites into significant pathways, which were statistically compared using principal component analysis. Acute hyperglycemia induced changes to 10 metabolic pathways, including but not limited to increases in cysteine and methionine metabolism (0.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis (0.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10, p\u2009=\u20090.002); and nitrogen metabolism (0.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03, p\u2009=\u20090.003). Introduction of empagliflozin was associated with a decrease in adenine, and an increase in cysteine and methionine metabolism (0.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13, p\u2009=\u20090.02) when maintained under euglycemia and a decrease in nitrogen metabolism under hyperglycemia (-0.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Our findings show that SGLT2 inhibition counteracts the hyperglycemia-induced changes in plasma amino acid metabolism, potentially improving energy efficiency and metabolic health, though more research is needed to confirm these metabolic effects."

The patient started her treatment with subcutaneous insulin, but her blood sugar level was poorly controlled. She was later found to have a KCNJ11 mutation and was subsequently switched to sulfonylurea, which offered better control of blood sugars. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing signs and symptoms such as polyuria and vomiting along with the profound impact of genetic changes such as KCNJ11 in the pathophysiology of the condition. Genetic counseling is necessary for affected families, and increases awareness of potential complications, particularly those related to DKA and associated neurological risks."

Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the clinical and safety outcomes in patients taking empagliflozin and Sitagliptin in addition to metformin. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a non-probability consecutive sampling technique to gather data at the Diabetes and Foot Care Clinic in Abbottabad from July 2023 to December 2023. This is an exploratory observational study in which a total of 155 study participants were selected and divided into two groups: Group A, treated with Sitagliptin add-on Metformin (n\u2009=\u200979), and Group B, treated with Empagliflozin add-on Metformin (n\u2009=\u200976), Biochemical parameters (HbA1c, serum creatinine) were collected and eGFR was calculated at baseline and after a 3-month follow-up. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Among the participant's majority (53.5%) were males whereas the mean age of the participants was 51.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5 years. Baseline HbA1c and serum creatinine of all the patients were found to be 9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8% and 1.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0mg\/dL respectively. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean HbA1c values in both the groups at baseline and follow-up (p\u2009<\u20090.001) whereas both the groups were found to be similar in their ability to reduce HbA1c (p\u2009=\u20090.25).

The association between WWI and depression in individuals with diabetes is still not well understood. This study explores this association in diabetic patients. This study involved adult participants diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in NHANES 2009\u20132018. We explored the association between WWI and depression through multivariate logistic regression analysis, subgroup analyses, interaction tests, and smoothed curve-fitting methods. In Model 3, this study found a significant positive association between WWI and depression among patients with diabetes (OR\u2009=\u20091.38, 95% CI: 1.17\u20131.63). In the smoothed curve fitting analysis, a nonlinear relationship between WWI and depression was observed, with an inflection point at 12.31. Subgroup analysis indicated that this association was influenced by the poverty income ratio (PIR), with a stronger association observed among diabetic patients with PIR\u2009\u2265\u20091, < 3, and PIR\u2009\u2265\u20093.

Current clinical prediction methods rely heavily on invasive biopsies and fall short of providing a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment. This multicenter study, conducted from 2010 to 2024, involved patients with biopsy-confirmed DKD. We employed logistic regression and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with 10-fold cross-validation to identify key predictive indicators. A machine learning-based nomogram was developed and model performance is evaluated by discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 337 were divided into training (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u2009180), internal validation (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u200978), and external validation (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u200979) cohorts. Multivariate analysis confirmed SCr (OR = 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.01-1.03), HDL (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52-0.85), and severe glomerular hyperplasia (OR = 9.79, 95% CI: 1.41-80.89) as independent predictors. The AUC for the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts were 0.93, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively, indicating high calibration accuracy (<i>p<\/i>\u2009>\u20090.05). DCA demonstrated a 75% higher net clinical benefit compared to traditional models at risk thresholds exceeding 18. In order to avoid repeated renal biopsy puncture, by integrating kidney function, metabolic markers, and pathological features, the model provides more accurate diagnosis and treatment suggestions for predicting the risk of TILs and further deterioration of renal function. This facilitates the early identification of high-risk patients and supports targeted interventions, marking a paradigm shift toward precision nephrology in the management of DKD."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of 8\u00a0weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on insulin resistance through liver gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipogenesis in Type 2 diabetic rats with a special focus on the role of SPX. In this study, 28 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Healthy Control (CON), Diabetes Control (T2D), HIIT, and Diabetes+HIIT (T2D+HIIT). After diabetes induction (high-fat diet+streptozotocin), the exercise groups underwent an 8-week HIIT protocol. HOMA-\u03b2, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, fasting blood sugar, insulin, and SPX were measured in liver and serum. The expression of Galanin\/2, FOXO-1, PGC-1\u03b1, G6Pase, PEPCK, CPT1A, AMPK, PPAR\u03b1, ACC, FAS, SREBP-1c, SIRT-1, and inflammatory\/antioxidant markers were analyzed in the liver. Our results showed that HOMA-\u03b2, QUICKI, insulin, and serum level of SPX levels were higher in T2D+HIIT than T2D group. Similarly, SPX, GALR2, FOXO-1, PGC-1\u03b1, CPT1A, PPAR\u03b1, AMPK, and SIRT-1 levels were higher in the livers of rats in the T2D+HIIT than T2D group. However, HOMA-IR, PEPCK, G6Pase, ACC, FAS, and SREBP-1c levels were lower in T2D+HIIT than T2D group. Also, HIIT+T2D reduced inflammation and increased antioxidants, indicating an improved overall health status of the liver. HIIT benefits diabetic liver with reducing gluconeogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipogenesis while increasing lipolysis. These improvements coincided with elevated hepatic SPX signaling and are associated with reduced insulin resistance. These findings suggest a potential association between HIIT induced SPX signaling modulation in liver and improving insulin resistance, though further mechanistic studies are required to confirm the causality."

This study investigated the differences in gut microbial diversity, composition, and metabolomic profiles between diabetic and control individuals. Using 16\u00a0S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomic analyses, we observed significantly higher microbial diversity and evenness in the diabetic group, with distinct clustering patterns as revealed by Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). Taxonomic profiling demonstrated an increased relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Lachnospiraceae in the diabetic group, while Streptococcaceae was more prevalent in the control group. LEfSe analysis identified key microbial taxa such as Bacteroides, Blautia, and Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group enriched in diabetic individuals, suggesting a role in metabolic dysregulation. Metabolomic pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant differences in pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, bile acid metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis in diabetic individuals. Enriching fatty acid elongation and \u03b2-oxidation pathways, alongside disrupted glucose metabolism, indicate profound metabolic changes associated with diabetes. Bile acid metabolism and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathways were also elevated, linking these metabolites to the observed gut microbiota shifts. These findings suggest that diabetes is associated with significant alterations in the gut microbiome's composition and function, leading to disruptions in critical metabolic pathways. This study provides insights into potential microbial biomarkers and therapeutic targets for improving metabolic health in diabetic patients."

Tailored preference-based self-care management may improve clinical and cost-effectiveness. This study investigates associations between elicited time and risk preferences with diabetes-related outcomes, i.e., Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood glucose level. Time and risk preferences of 396 T2D patients were measured by incentivized tasks. Clinical data was retrieved from hospital information systems for diabetes outcomes (HbA1c and blood glucose levels) and clinical factors. We assessed patient diabetes-associated self-care behaviors and other epidemiological factors by questionnaire. Multivariate linear regressions with stepwise model selection were used to evaluate potential associations with T2D outcomes. We found that participants who favored immediate gratification over greater long-term benefits (time-inconsistent towards present or present-biased) had significantly higher HbA1c levels than time-consistent participants, with a coefficient (95% CI) of 0.41 (0.02,0.80). Neither time nor risk preferences were significantly associated with blood glucose levels. These findings suggest the use of tailored diabetes interventions to help present-biased patients overcome self-control problems.

Although maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) are established risk factors in Western populations, their interactions with metabolic and sociodemographic factors in Asian cohorts, particularly within China's rapidly urbanizing populations, warrant further investigation. This prospective cohort study analyzed 1,026,294 singleton pregnancies (2012-2018) from the Liaoning Maternal and Child Health Information System. Using multivariate logistic regression models, we calculated adjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate associations between prenatal exposures\u2026 and birth outcomes: low birth weight (LBW), macrosomia (>\u20094000\u00a0g), Small-for-gestational-age (SGA, <\u200910th percentile), Large-for-gestational-age (LGA, >\u200990th percentile), PTB.

        "Abstract":"Identity crisis during adolescence is an important issue; on the other hand, adolescents suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes increase the challenges of this period and the importance of successfully overcoming it. The present study was conducted with the aim of comparing identity crisis in adolescents with cancer and diabetes. This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2022 to November 2024 on 300 adolescents within the age range of 15-17 years with cancer and diabetes (150 in each group) who were selected with convenience sampling. Data were collected using demographic characteristics and identity crisis questionnaires. Data analysis was performed using SPSS-22 software. The significance level in all tests was less than 0.05. The mean of identity crisis in adolescents with cancer and diabetes was 130.82\u2009\u00b1\u20092.38 and 123.49\u2009\u00b1\u20092.45, respectively. The mean total score of identity crisis and scores of areas of dissatisfaction with life, hopelessness, sadness (p\u2009<\u20090.001), aimlessness, worthlessness, and anxiety (p\u2009<\u20090.01) were higher in adolescents with cancer than in those with diabetes. The variables of the age of adolescents, cancer duration, family income, and education of the mother predicted 56.63% of the variance changes in the identity crisis of adolescents with cancer and 55.76% of the variance changes in the identity crisis of adolescents with diabetes. Identity crisis is one of the important challenges in the lives of adolescents with cancer and diabetes. These adolescents experience moderate to severe identity crises, and this condition is more common in adolescents with cancer. Not applicable."

This study aimed to assess insulin-treated patient experiences using the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) and to identify key predictors impacting patient experiences. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 220 insulin-treated adults at primary healthcare clinics across the West Bank, Palestine. The subscale scores were 68.8% \u00b1 26.6% for regimen inconvenience, 68.3% \u00b1 28.1% for lifestyle flexibility, 58.0% \u00b1 18.7% for glycemic control, 62.2% \u00b1 21.0% for delivery-device satisfaction, and 72.3% \u00b1 16.5% overall ITSQ score. Multiple linear regression was used to explore associations between ITSQ domains and candidate predictors. Delivery-device satisfaction was independently lower among female patients (\u03b2 = -\u20090.18, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and in those with type 2 diabetes (vs. type 1; \u03b2 = -\u20090.14, p\u2009=\u20090.037).

        "Abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy is a serious ocular complication that poses a significant threat to patients' vision and overall health. Early detection and accurate grading are essential to prevent vision loss. Current automatic grading methods rely heavily on deep learning applied to retinal fundus images, but the complex, irregular patterns of lesions in these images, which vary in shape and distribution, make it difficult to capture the subtle changes. This study introduces RadFuse, a multi-representation deep learning framework that integrates non-linear RadEx-transformed sinogram images with traditional fundus images to enhance diabetic retinopathy detection and grading. Our RadEx transformation, an optimized non-linear extension of the Radon transform, generates sinogram representations to capture complex retinal lesion patterns. By leveraging both spatial and transformed domain information, RadFuse enriches the feature set available to deep learning models, improving the differentiation of severity levels. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, APTOS-2019 and DDR, using three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNeXt-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG19. RadFuse showed significant improvements over fundus-image-only models across all three CNN architectures and outperformed state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. For severity grading across five stages, RadFuse achieved a quadratic weighted kappa of 93.24%, an accuracy of 87.07%, and an F1-score of 87.17%. In binary classification between healthy and diabetic retinopathy cases, the method reached an accuracy of 99.09%, precision of 98.58%, and recall of 99.64%, surpassing previously established models. These results demonstrate RadFuse's capacity to capture complex non-linear features, advancing diabetic retinopathy classification and promoting the integration of advanced mathematical transforms in medical image analysis.

        "Abstract":"Diabetes is a significant modifiable risk factor for cognitive dysfunction. There are currently no effective treatments that delay or reverse the progression of cognitive dysfunction. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that specific antidiabetes medications hold promise in improving cognitive function. However, the comparative effects of various antidiabetic drug classes on cognitive protection remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate and compare the cognitive benefits of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin on achieving mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remission in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The LIGHT-MCI trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, superiority trial involving T2D patients with MCI, consisting of a 48-week core study followed by an extension phase through to 76 weeks. A total of 396 participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1 to receive liraglutide, empagliflozin or linagliptin treatment. The primary outcome measure is the efficacy difference of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin in achieving MCI remission in individuals with T2D. The key secondary outcome measures include changes in scores of general cognition and various cognitive subdomains (including processing speed, executive function, immediate memory, visuospatial construction ability, language, attention and delayed memory), basic and instrumental daily living ability, MRI-derived normalised measures of total brain volume, cerebral microstructures, cortical and nuclear volume, white matter hyperintensity, volume, white matter microstructural integrity, odour-induced brain activation and resting-state functional connectivity, olfactory function and metabolic parameters. The LIGHT-MCI trial has received approval from the Ethics Committees of the Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University Medical School (2022-092-02) and other participating centres in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP E6).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs, pivotal in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, exhibit diverse physiological effects. While their impact on glycemic control is well-established, understanding their influence on hematological parameters remains an active area of investigation. A cohort of 700 patients prescribed GLP-1 analogs between March 2021 and October 2022 was analyzed. Demographic data, baseline hemoglobin, ferritin levels, and subsequent measurements were collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, subgroup analyses, and multivariable logistic regression. Following GLP-1 analog initiation, a statistically significant decrease in hemoglobin levels was observed (median decrease: 0.2 g\/dL), with 59 patients (8.4%) developing anemia. Ferritin levels showed no significant change. Subgroup analyses by gender and medication type revealed no significant differences in hemoglobin changes. Baseline hemoglobin demonstrated a significant inverse association with anemia development (OR=0.31, 95% CI: 0.21-0.44, <i>p<\/i><0.01). This study contributes valuable insights into the complex interplay between GLP-1 analogs and hematological parameters. Clinicians should be aware of potential hematological effects, with baseline hemoglobin levels serving as a valuable predictor of anemia risk. Future prospective studies are warranted to deepen understanding and refine clinical strategies in the use of GLP-1 analogs."

This case-control study enrolled 177 eyes from 177 patients that underwent cataract surgery between April 2019 and November 2022 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Group 1 comprised 103 eyes from patients without diabetes; group 2 comprised 40 eyes from patients with diabetes but without DR; and group 3 comprised 34 eyes from patients with DR. Aqueous humor samples were collected and analyzed for TAC and AA levels using the ferric reducing\/antioxidant AA assay. Aqueous humor TAC and AA levels were decreased in group 3 compared with group 2 and group 1 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). Aqueous humor TAC and AA levels were independent protective factors against DR in the diabetes population, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.109 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.017-0.719, P = 0.021) and 0.095 (95% CI = 0.012-0.726, P = 0.023), respectively. Aqueous humor TAC and AA concentrations were weakly negatively correlated with serum HbA1c levels, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of -0.339 (P = 0.013) and -0.341 (P = 0.012), respectively. TAC and AA had protective effects against DR. Decreased aqueous humor TAC and AA levels may serve as potential biomarkers for DR among the diabetes population.

In this prospective, 1-year observational study, 208 patients with diabetes (320 eyes) underwent 3 \u00d7 3 mm macular OCTA at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Registered, averaged images yielded geometric perfusion deficits (GPDs), vessel density (VD), vessel length density (VLD) in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses (SCP and DCP), and foveal avascular zone area. Eyes were graded as non-referable or referable. Linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, and hypertension were conducted. Post hoc Dunnett's tests compared follow-ups with baseline within each severity group. A total of 709 eye visits were analyzed by OCTA. Across the cohort, referable DR, longer diabetes duration, and hypertension were independently associated with higher GPD values. In referable eyes, GPD-DCP increased at 6 months (P = 0.036) and 1 year (P = 0.016), whereas no other OCTA metric changed significantly at 6 months. In non-referable eyes, the only significant change was a decrease in VD-SCP at 1 year (P = 0.004). Microvascular progression follows distinct, layer-specific patterns. In non-referable DR, capillary ischemia progresses more slowly and is more prominent in the SCP. In referable DR, GPD-DCP detected the earliest signs of microvascular progression and may serve as a promising biomarker, preceding vessel-based metrics. These findings suggest that the most informative OCTA metric should be tailored not only to the study question or timeline, but also to DR severity."

        "Abstract":"To investigate the role of PON1 in diabetic nephropathy and elucidate the underlying mechanisms using a cellular model. A diabetic nephropathy model was established using high glucose-induced HK-2 cells. Potential target genes and signaling pathways were identified through bioinformatics databases, and PON1 expression was manipulated to interfere with these pathways. The effects of different treatments on cell conditions were systematically evaluated. PON1, the targeted gene in diabetic nephropathy, was significantly downregulated in high glucose-induced cells. The PPAR\u03b3 signaling pathway was identified as closely associated with PON1, with both PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 emerging as key regulators within this pathway. We observed significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase activity, malondialdehyde levels, and cell apoptosis, along with notable decreases in superoxide dismutase levels, cell viability, and cell proliferation, in the high glucose-treated group. Additionally, the expression levels of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 were also decreased. Overexpression of PON1 (pc-PON1) in the high glucose group mitigated these effects, whereas treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 reversed the protective changes induced by pc-PON1. Elevated PON1 levels mitigated oxidative stress and inhibited cell death, thereby promoting cell growth and alleviating diabetic nephropathy through activation of the PPAR\u03b3 signaling pathway."

Despite global initiatives, feasibility constraints limit widespread implementation of diabetes prevention\/control measures. The key to facilitating the implementation of diabetes prevention and control measures lies in prioritise them. This study aimed to determine the priority of diabetes prevention and control measures in China from the feasibility perspective. From January to February 2021, an online survey was administered to professionals specifically responsible for implementing chronic disease prevention and control programs in 488 national demonstration areas in China. The survey assessed the importance and feasibility of 44 diabetes prevention and control measures across 10 dimensions. The Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) model categorized these indicators into four quadrants: Highest Priority (high importance and feasibility), Priority Improvement (high importance, low feasibility), Lowest Priority (low importance and feasibility), and Secondary Improvement (low importance, high feasibility). Quadrant 1 ('Highest Priority') included health education, community action, high-risk discovery and intervention, and medical insurance and family doctors, which should be maintained and strengthened. Quadrant 2 ('Priority Improvement') included patient management and complication screening, necessitating targeted efforts to enhance implementation. Quadrant 3 ('Lowest Priority') included personal health services assessment follow-up, environmental support, sugar reduction policy, and diabetes co-infection prevention, indicating a risk of overinvestment. No indicators were categorized into Quadrant 4 ('Secondary Priority'). Prioritizing diabetes prevention and control measures based on feasibility maximizes the utilization of limited resources, providing implementable recommendations for policymakers."

However, the epidemiology of T1DM and CKD due to T1DM in children aged 0-14\u00a0years remains poorly quantified worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the global burden and trends of these conditions in this pediatric population. Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data, we evaluated the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of T1DM and CKD due to T1DM among children aged 0-14\u00a0years from 1990 to 2021. From 1990 to 2021, the global incidence number of T1DM in children aged 0-14\u00a0years increased, and the age-standardized incidence rate(ASIR) increased. The prevalence increased, the age-standardized prevalence rate(ASPR)increased, but the age-standardized DALYs rate(ASDR) decreased. The ASIR, ASPR, and ASDR of CKD due to T1DM decreased. At the same time, health inequality analysis reveals a worsening of disparities among different countries. The global burden of T1DM and CKD due to T1DM among children aged 0-14\u00a0years is facing new challenges, highlighting the urgent need to reinforce and develop more effective public health policies and clinical prevention strategies."

        "Abstract":"Despite considerable efforts to treat chronic wounds, success has been limited. The cellular and molecular processes that disrupt normal healing and contribute to the initiation and development of chronic wounds are not well understood. As a result, developing effective treatments for these wounds has proven challenging. This is primarily because of the lack of animal models that mimic chronic wounds in humans and because experimentation in humans with chronic wounds is limited. Previously, we have published a mouse model to study chronic wounds that share many characteristics with diabetic chronic wounds in humans. This model includes the presence of biofilms formed naturally from bacteria found in skin microbiota and the environment without the need to introduce external bacteria into the wounds. Therefore, this model can potentially advance the fundamental understanding of how wounds become chronic. Here, we present an update to the original protocol for developing this mouse model. We have concentrated on decreasing the mortality of mice from ~30% to ~5%. We also describe how this model has been used to understand the initiation and progression of wound chronicity by using next-generation transcriptomic approaches, elucidating bacterial population dynamics during infection and biofilm development, and demonstrating the value of testing the efficacy of treatments, including small molecules. So far, this is the only chronic wound model that does not heal without intervention."

Herein, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics was employed to investigate the changes in serum metabolites of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats in response to pioglitazone treatment. Both untargeted and targeted analyses were conducted to identify and quantify the key metabolic perturbations. Multivariate analysis modeling such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal projections to latent structures DA (OPLS-DA) revealed significant differences in the metabolic profiles among the diabetic, pioglitazone-treated, and control groups. A panel of 15 differentially altered metabolites was identified, of which a targeted quantification was performed of 6 key metabolites that were significantly modulated by pioglitazone treatment. These metabolites include two branched-chain amino acids (l-isoleucine, l-valine), two organic acids (lactic, beta-hydroxybutyric), and two fatty acids (palmitic, stearic). Interestingly, pathway analysis revealed the inability of pioglitazone to restore the levels of some metabolites, suggesting possible persistent metabolic alterations in diabetes even after treatment. This metabolic signature offers significant potential for clinical translation, serving as a biomarker panel for monitoring diabetes progression and therapeutic efficacy. Such comprehensive GC-MS metabolomics platform provides a robust analytical framework for accelerating diabetes drug discovery, enabling precise therapeutic monitoring, and facilitating personalized medicine approaches in diabetes management."

The study population consisted of 98 GDM patients and 71 healthy pregnant women. Subjects' serum were collected early in pregnancy (10-12\u00a0weeks) for cryopreservation. Gene expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. miR-326 was evaluated by ROC for its diagnostic value. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to calculate the relationship between miR-326 and glycemic index and TLR4. Logistic analysis resulted in risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. CCK8, transwell, and flow cytometry were performed to observe changes in trophoblast function after different treatments. DLR verified the targeting relationship between genes. miR-326 is upregulated in early pregnancy serum of GDM patients and has a predictive diagnostic value for GDM. There is a positive correlation between miR-326 and glycemic indices (HbA1c, FBG, HOMA-IR) in GDM patients, which is a risk factor for inducing adverse pregnancy outcomes. miR-326 inhibitor restored the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of high glucose-treated (HG group) cells and reduced apoptosis. TLR4 is a target gene of miR-326, and the expression of the two is negatively correlated in GDM patients. Transfection of si-TLR4 resisted the changes in trophoblast cells induced by the use of miR-326 inhibitor. High levels of miR-326 are upregulated in serum of GDM patients in early pregnancy. miR-326 targeted inhibition of TLR4 causes abnormal trophoblast cell function and induces adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM patients."

Sinomenine hydrochloride (SH), an active component derived from traditional Chinese medicine, is clinically effective in treating kidney diseases. This study investigates the protective effects of SH on podocytes under high-glucose conditions and its mechanism of action. Mouse podocytes (MPC-5) were treated with SH at concentrations of 50, 200, and 600\u2009\u03bcg\/mL under high-glucose conditions (30\u2009mmol\/L) for 24\u2009h to establish a DKD model. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 assays, and apoptosis rates were measured using flow cytometry. Autophagy levels were evaluated by detecting LC3-II, Beclin-1, and P62 proteins via Western blot analysis, while the involvement of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway was analyzed by examining phosphorylated AKT and mTOR. Transmission electron microscopy was employed to observe autophagosomes. SH improved podocyte viability, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced autophagic activity by increasing LC3-II and Beclin-1 expression while decreasing P62 levels. SH also downregulated p-AKT and p-mTOR, indicating inhibition of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway. Electron microscopy confirmed increased autophagosomes in SH-treated groups. SH protects podocytes in a high-glucose environment by enhancing autophagy through inhibition of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway.

The secondary objective was to study the incidence of super obesity in the study population. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted over eleven years (January 2013-December 2023) at Fernandez Hospital, a tertiary perinatal care center with approximately 8000 births per annum. Data were sourced from electronic medical records. The study group included women with singleton pregnancies with BMI\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00a0kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, birthed at the center and the control group included all other women. The overall incidence of super obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00a0kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) was 1 in 1000 births. On comparing women with various BMI ranges, there was a significant increase in maternal complications such as chronic hypertension, pregnancy induced hypertension, pregestational diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001) as the BMI increased. Super obese women experienced high rates of cesarean section (54%, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.009), fetal growth abnormalities like small for gestational age (12%, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.017), large for gestational age (17%, <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and stillbirths (1%, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.001). Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes are directly proportional to maternal obesity. This emphasizes that these women should be managed at a dedicated clinic for comprehensive multidisciplinary care."

        "Abstract":"GDM is an intermediate phase in a woman's life that certainly poses a high risk of type 2 diabetes. Maternal health affects the health of offspring, a precursor of the vicious cycle of diabetes that continues through generations. Knowing the causative factors of GDM is important to breaking this cycle. To study the risk factors of GDM in Indian women. The observational study database records from 2022 to 2023 from 11 different centres across India. We included pregnant women diagnosed with GDM with any OGTT criteria and excluded women with pre-existing diabetes. A total of 431 women with GDM were included in the study. 166 women were diagnosed with GDM in the 3rd trimester, followed by 235 women in the 2nd trimester, and 30 women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Those detected with GDM during the 1st trimester had a BMI of 27.9\u00a0kg\/m2, followed by 28.3 and 29.3\u00a0kg\/m2 in 3rd trimester. Multigravida showed a positive correlation with a family history of T2D (0.04), previous history of GDM (<i>p<\/i>-value\u2009<\u20090.001), history of stillbirth (<i>p<\/i>-value\u2009<\u20090.001) and hypertension (<i>p<\/i>-value 0.03). Pre-pregnancy BMI and women's age at family planning are two important risk factors for the prevention of gestational diabetes."

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a common chronic disease, and there is a rising trend globally; insulin is the mainstay therapy. Despite improvements in insulin delivery and monitoring, a significant percentage of patients still fail to reach glycemic targets. There is an increasing interest in using glucagon-like receptor agonists as adjuvant therapy. A high risk of bias limits meta-analysis on the effectiveness of GLP-1 agonists. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of GLP-1 agonists on HbA1c and total daily insulin dose in T1DM. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for articles investigating the effects of GLP-1 agonists on the HbA1<sub>c<\/sub> and total daily insulin dose without limitation to the publication date. The keywords used were GLP-1 agonists, liraglutide, albiglutide, exenatide, glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c, insulin dose, and glycemic control. Out of the 713 articles retrieved, 21 full texts were screened, and 10 trials were included in the meta-analysis. GLP-1 agonists are more effective than placebo in HbA1c reduction, <i>Z<\/i> = 5.27, SMD, 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.32, with 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg more effective than 0.6 mg, SMD, -0.87, 95% CI, -1.60 to 0.13, and SMD, -0.79, 95% CI, -1.18 to 0.41, respectively. GLP-1 agonists reduce total daily insulin dose SMD, 2.21, 95% CI, 0.43-3.98 with no significant differences between different doses. GLP-1 agonists were effective in HbA1c and total daily insulin reduction among patients with T1DM. Liraglutide 1.2 mg may be more beneficial; further randomized trials focusing on different doses of GLP-1 agonists and hypoglycemia risk are recommended."

        "Abstract":"Osteoporosis is a common complication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), yet its screening rate remains low. This study aimed to develop and validate a cost-effective and interpretable machine learning (ML) model to predict the risk of osteoporosis in patients with T2DM. This retrospective study included 1560 inpatients who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) between January 2022 and December 2023 at Panyu Hospital of Chinese Medicine. Demographic information and laboratory test results obtained within 24 hours of hospital admission were collected. Potential predictive features were identified using univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and the Boruta algorithm. Eight supervised ML algorithms were applied to construct predictive models. Model performance was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the model and visualize feature importance. Ten predictive features were selected based on the intersection of the three feature selection methods. Among the tested models, logistic regression achieved the best overall performance, with an AUC of 0.812, an accuracy of 0.762, a sensitivity of 0.809, a specificity of 0.761, and an F1 score of 0.771 in the validation set. Calibration plots and DCA curves demonstrated good agreement and the highest net clinical benefit. SHAP analysis identified age, sex, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, hemoglobin, and neutrophil count as the six most influential features. An easy-to-use, web-based risk calculator was developed based on the logistic model and is available at: https:\/\/t2dm.shinyapps.io\/t2dm-osteoporosis\/. We developed an interpretable and accessible ML-based online tool that enables preliminary screening of osteoporosis risk in patients with T2DM using routine blood indicators. This tool may assist clinicians in early risk identification and reduce the underdiagnosis of osteoporosis."

This study aimed to identify a metabolic signature linked with T1D. Untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on peripheral blood samples from T1D patients (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 40). Data preprocessing and quality control were conducted using MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Differential metabolites (DMs) were identified via Wilcoxon rank-sum test (P< 0.05), and key diagnostic markers were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model was used for <i>in vivo<\/i> validation. A total of 157 annotated metabolites were detected (58 in ESI- and 99 in ESI+ mode). Twenty-six DMs were identified, including 25 upregulated and 1 downregulated in the T1D group, mainly involving Acylcarnitines and xanthine metabolites. LASSO regression selected Hydroxyhexadecanoyl carnitine, Propionylcarnitine, and Valerylcarnitine as candidate markers. In the rat model, Hydroxyhexadecanoyl carnitine and Valerylcarnitine demonstrated strong diagnostic performance, with AUCs of 0.9383 (95% CI: 0.8786-0.9980) and 0.8395 (95% CI: 0.7451-0.9338), respectively (P< 0.01). Hydroxyhexadecanoyl carnitine and Valerylcarnitine are closely linked to altered lipid oxidation in T1D and show strong potential as diagnostic biomarkers. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic basis of T1D and offer promising targets for early detection."

        "Abstract":"Ischemic stroke occurring during sleep has been known as wake-up stroke, and many studies have been conducted on the subject. On the other hand, there have only been a few studies on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurring during sleep. To clarify their clinical characteristics and possible risk factors, a single-center retrospective study was conducted on nontraumatic ICH patients admitted to our institution between 2012 and 2017. Demographics and outcomes were compared between 119 patients with ICH occurring during sleep (sleep group) and 401 patients with ICH occurring during the awake period (awake group). Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors. Furthermore, clinical presentation in those 119 patients was further classified into three categories (deficits, sudden headache, and failure to wake up), and their association to the outcomes was evaluated. Compared with the awake group, the frequency of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus were significantly higher in the sleep group. Multivariate regression analysis identified CKD as a risk factor for ICH occurring during sleep. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in the sleep group. Among the three classifications, failure to wake up was indicative of high mortality rate. The current results that ICH occurring during sleep was indicative of worse outcomes is compatible with prior studies. Poorly controlled nocturnal hypertension in patients with CKD and diabetes mellitus may be responsible for the higher incidence of ICH occurring sleep in those populations. The three classifications according to clinical presentation may be useful as a prognosticator."

        "Abstract":"Biliary tuberculosis is a rare form of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i> infection, accounting for only 0.0-0.1% of all TB cases in certain settings. Its preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and the lack of specific imaging criteria. Often, it mimics other diseases like cancers and infections, complicating early detection. A 51-year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and a biliary stricture following stent placement presented with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weight loss for 4 months. A CT scan revealed an indwelling common bile duct (CBD) stent, mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and pneumobilia. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure was performed with stent exchange. Initial CBD biopsy showed chronic inflammation, but both biopsy and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were negative for malignancy. A subsequent ERCP with additional biopsies also returned negative results for malignancy, though CBD brushing tested positive for <i>M. tuberculosis<\/i>. The diagnosis of biliary tuberculosis is challenging due to its nonspecific presentation. In this case, the positive result for <i>M. tuberculosis<\/i> in the CBD brushing led to the diagnosis, even after negative biopsy and FNA results. Early recognition of hepatobiliary tuberculosis is crucial as it enables conservative management with stents and anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). Biliary tuberculosis, although rare, should be considered in patients with unexplained biliary symptoms. Timely diagnosis through appropriate diagnostic procedures can lead to effective treatment with ATT and stenting, improving patient outcomes, and preventing more invasive treatments."

Although transient ischaemic dilation (TID) is a sign of extensive coronary artery disease when accompanied by perfusion defects, its significance with normal perfusion remains unclear. We aim to study the relationship between the LV size and the TID ratio (TIDr) amongst females with normal SPECT MPI. Retrospective single-centre study of female patients with normal dipyridamole stress MPI, defined as the summed stress score = 0 with both stress and rest LV ejection fraction \u226550% on gated images. Small LV was defined as a gated rest end diastolic volume (EDV) below the 20th percentile of the study cohort. TIDr was derived using the quantitative perfusion SPECT software. There were 107 female patients (mean age-70) included. The threshold for small LV size was determined to be an EDV of <36.6\u2005mL. Patients with or without small LV were similar in age, ethnicity, body mass index, and comorbidities. TIDr was significantly greater for patients with small LV (1.33 vs. 1.28, <i>P<\/i> = 0.042). There was a significant negative correlation between the resting EDV and the TIDr (<i>r<\/i> = -0.34, <i>P<\/i> < 0.001), which remained significant after controlling for age, body mass index, resting left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (<i>r<\/i> = -0.35, <i>P<\/i> < 0.001). In females with a normal dipyridamole stress SPECT MPI, TIDr is significantly higher in those with small LV. LV size should be considered when interpreting TID in females with otherwise normal MPI."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common metabolic disorder typically managed with medication; however, fasting has recently attracted attention for its potential benefits in glycemic control, weight management, and even potential remission. This case report examines the effects of repeated long-term fasting on weight reduction, glycemic control, and medication requirements in a 57-year-old man with T2DM. The patient, who had a history of inadequate glycemic control despite conventional treatment, opted for repeated long-term fasting under medical supervision. He completed several fasts ranging from 11 to 20 days each, with each fasting period followed by a gradual reintroduction of food via a hypocaloric lactovegetarian diet (800-1,800 kcal) over 4 to 16 days. The intervention resulted in sustained weight loss and improved blood sugar control. Notably, clinically meaningful improvements occurred in fasting blood glucose levels, which necessitated adjustments in his antidiabetic medications. Enhanced insulin sensitivity was evidenced by decreased HbA1c levels and a reduced dependence on hypoglycemic agents. Additionally, post-fasting evaluations indicated improvements in inflammatory markers and a reduction in fatty liver disease. In summary, repeated long-term fasting in this patient was associated with sustained weight loss, improved glycemic control, and reduced medication requirements, thereby enhancing the overall management of T2DM. Further research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to better understand the long-term safety and effectiveness of this intervention."

Objective The objective of this study was to assess the use of herbal medicines for the treatment of DM among diabetic patients in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sample of 53 diabetic patients (both genders, aged 20-55 years). A predesigned, structured questionnaire was used to collect data on patients' demographics, DM-related clinical information, use of herbal products for DM treatment, types of herbs used, duration of use, perceived effectiveness in lowering blood sugar, any side effects, and sources of information about the herbs. Results Among the participants, 60.4% were aged 50-55 years, 79.2% were female, 54.7% had a university education, 45.3% were employed, 35.8% had a monthly income of 10,001-20,000 SAR, and 7.5% were ex-smokers. Chronic diseases were reported by 58.5% of participants, with hypertension (61.3%) and hypercholesterolemia (51.6%) being the most common comorbidities. The duration of DM was 16-20 years for 35.8% of participants, and 73.6% were on oral hypoglycemic agents. The prevalence of herbal medicine use was 56.6%, with cinnamon (43.4%), coriander (33.3%), and moringa (30%) being the most commonly used herbs. Most users (70.1%) reported that the herbal remedies were effective in lowering blood sugar levels, and none reported any side effects. No statistically significant associations were found between herbal medicine use and participants' demographic or clinical characteristics. Conclusions More than half of the diabetic patients in this study reported using herbal remedies. Further longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate usage patterns and determine the potential benefits and\/or risks of herbal medicine use in DM management."

Assessing the need for psychosocial support is essential for prevention. This project aims to investigate the use of supervised machine learning in the form of text classification in identifying childhood cancer patients needing psychosocial support from nursing notes when at least 1\u2005year had passed from their cancer diagnosis. We evaluated three well-known machine learning-based models to recognize patients who had outpatient clinic reservations in the mental health-related care units from free-text nursing notes of 1,672 patients. For model training, the patients were children diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or cancer, while evaluation of the model was done on the patients diagnosed with cancer. A stratified fivefold nested cross-validation was used. We designed this as a binary classification task, with the following labels: no support (0) or psychosocial support (1) was needed. Patients with the latter label were identified by having an outpatient appointment reservation in a mental health-related care unit at least 1\u2005year after their primary diagnosis. The random forest classification model trained on both cancer and diabetes patients performed best for the cancer patient population in three-times repeated nested cross-validation with 0.798 mean area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and was better with 99% probability (credibility interval -0.2840 to -0.0422) than the neural network-based model using only cancer patients in training when comparing all classifiers pairwise by using the Bayesian correlated t-test. Using machine learning to predict childhood cancer patients needing psychosocial support was possible using nursing notes with a good area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. The reported experiment indicates that machine learning may assist in identifying patients likely to need mental health-related support later in life."

Falls pose significant risks of morbidity and mortality, yet the interplay between T2D, CVD, and fall risk remains insufficiently understood. This study aimed to systematically assess the current evidence and estimate the risk of falls in people with coexisting T2D and CVD. A systematic literature search and a meta-analysis were conducted utilizing PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane using PRISMA guidelines. Studies assessing fall risk in people with T2D, with or without CVD, were included. Quality assessment was performed using validated tools such as JADAD, NOS, and GRADE. Existing literature indicates that people with T2D and coexisting CVD have a significantly higher risk of falls compared to those with T2D without CVD. This association was confirmed by the meta-analysis, which demonstrated a pooled odds ratio of 1.29 (95% CI 1.03-1.63). However, clear associations between specific cardiovascular outcomes-such as hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic disease-and fall risk remained inconclusive. Some studies indicated that autonomic dysfunction, postural instability, and blood pressure dysregulation contributed to fall risk, but findings were inconsistent. The heterogeneity in study methodologies, outcome measures, and sample populations limits definitive conclusions. This review and meta-analysis found an increased fall risk in people with T2D and coexisting CVD; however, current evidence remains insufficient to establish a definitive causal relationship between CVD and fall risk, despite the observed higher fall prevalence."

The main findings were derived from the utilisation of inverse variance weighted (IVW), while supplementary results were obtained through the utilisation of MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the 'leave-one-out' method. Cochran's Q statistics were also used to quantify the heterogeneity of SNPs. 38 SNPs were finally included. The results of the IVW analysis indicate that myopia may exert an inhibitory effect on the development of diabetic retinopathy (OR=0.596, 95% CI (0.371, 0.957), p<0.05). Conversely, hypermetropia (OR=8.882, 95%\u2009CI (0.389\u00d710<sup>-3<\/sup>, 2.06\u00d710<sup>5<\/sup>), p>0.05) and astigmatism (OR=1.004, 95%\u2009CI (0.888, 1.135), p>0.05) do not exhibit a causal relationship with the risk of diabetic retinopathy. This two-sample Mendelian randomization study provides evidence that myopia may impede diabetic retinopathy occurrence, while hypermetropia and astigmatism show no significant causal effects. However, our analysis treats refractive errors as independent entities, which may not reflect their clinical interdependence. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate myopia's protective mechanisms."

        "Abstract":"Understanding the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on longitudinal cardiac remodelling requires three-dimensional analysis of longitudinal shape changes beyond scalar indicators such as mass and volumes. The aim of this study is to determine trajectories of cardiovascular risk factor-related remodelling in a large cohort imaging study. We examined 2,521 participants (54% female, aged 60\u00b19y) of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) at baseline and after 10 years. Myocardial remodelling was assessed by longitudinal left ventricular shape trajectories derived from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using a statistical shape atlas. Penalized logistic regression was used to examine the associations between trajectory scores and cardiovascular risk factors, after adjustment for sex and age at baseline. Multivariate regression was used to determine independent shape changes associated with each risk factor. Between baseline and follow-up, there was a higher prevalence of hypertension (18.4%), antihypertensive medication usage (21.6%), statin usage, and treated diabetes mellitus (8.9%); all p < 0.05. Longitudinal shape trajectory scores had stronger associations with obesity, high blood pressure, hypertension medication and diabetes mellitus, than mass and volume changes (p<0.05). Multivariate regression showed independent longitudinal changes in wall thickening with obesity (13% increase), smoking (11% decrease), and high systolic blood pressure (5.6% increase), with distinct regional variations. Trajectories of cardiovascular risk factor-related longitudinal remodelling can be examined using shape atlases. In addition to global changes, each risk factor is associated with a distinct regional remodelling of the myocardium."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance (IR) and \u03b2-cell dysfunction, often exacerbated by excessive intake of saturated fatty acids, particularly palmitic acid (PA). As the most abundant saturated fatty acid in Western diets, PA contributes to metabolic dysregulation by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, activating inflammatory pathways, and impairing insulin signaling in hepatocytes. Consequently, PA-induced hepatic IR has become a widely accepted in vitro model for investigating therapeutic strategies to restore insulin sensitivity. This scoping review aims to identify and summarize natural and synthetic compounds evaluated in this model, emphasizing mechanisms of action and highlighting research gaps. A total of 78 eligible studies were selected through a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Most studies employed HepG2 cells and adopted co-incubation or post-treatment protocols to simulate preventive or therapeutic contexts. Natural compounds predominate, particularly polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and plant extracts. Reported mechanisms involved activation of insulin signaling pathways (phosphoinositide 3-kinase\/protein kinase B [PI3K\/Akt], adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase [AMPK]), attenuation of oxidative stress (reduced ROS and malondialdehyde [MDA], increased superoxide dismutase [SOD] and catalase [CAT]), inhibition of inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin-6 [IL-6], nuclear factor kappa B [NF-\u03baB]), and regulation of apoptosis (caspase-3, Bcl-2-associated X protein\/B-cell lymphoma 2 [BAX\/Bcl-2]). Overall, this model provides a robust and translationally relevant platform for screening bioactive compounds targeting multiple pathological features of T2DM."

        "Abstract":"The primary objective of this study is to investigate the associations between long-term metformin use, vitamin B12 status, and peripheral neuropathy. Secondarily, we aim to explore the effect of time since diagnosis on the relationships between metformin use, vitamin B12 deficiency, and peripheral neuropathy. A retrospective observational cross-sectional analysis was conducted using NIH's All of Us database. The risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy was compared among long-term metformin users (\u22654 years), short-term users (<4 years), and non-metformin users via a series of unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models. Among 14,808 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 9,136 (61.70\u00a0%) used metformin, of whom 5,609 (37.95\u00a0%) were long-term users. Following adjustment for confounders, long-term users exhibited a 67\u00a0% and 38\u00a0% higher likelihood of vitamin B12 deficiency than non-users and short-term users respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Peripheral neuropathy prevalence was 39\u00a0% higher among long-term users compared to short-term users (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with a non-statistically significant difference compared to non-users. Long-term metformin use is associated with both an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy in patients with T2DM. Providers should consider routinely assessing vitamin B12 status in long-term users, particularly when evaluating peripheral neuropathy symptoms."

        "Abstract":"The mitochondrial 3243A>G mutation (m.3243A>G) is associated with diverse clinical phenotypes. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms and explore intervention strategies in m.3243A>G patients, urine-derived stem cells (USCs) and a mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (lars-2) deficient Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model are used to assess mitochondrial homeostasis and neuromuscular dysfunction. Patient-derived USCs with high levels of m.3243A>G heteroplasmy exhibit impaired mitochondrial function, disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, and inhibited mitophagy, which are reversed by MitoQ through suppression of OMA1 zinc metallopeptidase (OMA1)-induced mitochondrial phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) induced kinase 1 (PINK1) degradation. Furthermore, lars-2 knockdown in C. elegans induces mitochondrial stress and mimics the loss of neural and muscle functions observed in patients with the m.3243A>G mutation. MitoQ treatment partially improves neurobehavioral function by promoting the PINK1 pathway. These findings suggest that MitoQ has therapeutic potential in the context of the m.3243A>G mutation."

No pharmacologic agent is currently approved for HCC chemoprevention. - To evaluate the association between sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use and risks of HCC and all-cause mortality in patients with MASLD and T2D. - Multinational, retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX federated electronic health record network (2005-2025). Adults aged 18-90 years with non-viral MASLD and pre-existing T2D were identified. We applied a 1-year washout, used an active-comparator design, and performed 1:1 propensity score matching. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were estimated with Cox models. - After matching, 93,930 SGLT2i users were compared with 93,930 active comparators with excellent covariate balance. Median follow-up was 3.24 years (IQR 1.72-5.09) in the SGLT2i group and 3.25 years (IQR 1.72-5.08) in comparators. HCC occurred in 43 (0.05 %) SGLT2i users vs 74 (0.08 %) comparators (aHR 0.43; 95 % CI 0.29-0.63). All-cause mortality was 5.32 % vs 10.50 % (aHR 0.34; 95 % CI 0.33-0.35). Results were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses, including time-anchored landmark analyses. Risk reductions were also observed for liver fibrosis\/cirrhosis and hepatic nodules. - Among patients with MASLD and T2D, SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with lower risks of HCC and all-cause mortality compared with active comparators. While residual confounding cannot be excluded, these findings support prospective evaluation of SGLT2 inhibitors for liver-related risk reduction in this population."

The patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma through biopsy from the ampulla of Vater during registration at our Centre in May 2010. She had yet to start her conventional treatment which was advised viz., surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. In June 2010, she underwent Whipple's resection. Histopathology report showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the periampullary region with metastasis to regional lymph nodes - Completely resected (R0). According to TNM (Tumor Node Metastasis) Staging System as per Union for International Cancer Control (UICC- 6th edition) patient was staged as pT3N1- Stage IIB. After completion of conventional treatment (surgery and chemotherapy) in October 2010, she continued with Ayurvedic treatment and follow-ups till date. Her tumour marker CA19.9 and sonography - abdomen, pelvis after 12 years revealed no evidence of malignancy. In May 2017, she was hospitalized for hematemesis and melena, diagnosed as mild gastritis with clean base ulcers at the surgical anastomosed (Gastrojejunostomy) site. She was treated accordingly with Ayurvedic medicines and her follow-up report showed the resolution of ulcers by September 2017. In May 2014, her mildly raised blood sugar (Fasting 138 mg\/dL; Post-Prandial 146 mg\/dL) was managed by a healthy lifestyle but in 2019, her blood glucose levels were moderately raised (Fasting 153 mg\/dL, Post-Prandial 187 mg\/dL) hence she was started on oral hypoglycemics which are continued till date. Though the pancreaticobiliary subtype is associated with poor prognosis, it was possible to achieve 12 years and 6 months of disease-free survival with adjunct Oral Ayurvedic Medicines (OAM) possessing antioxidant, immune-modulatory, anti-cancer, and hepato-protective action. She could tolerate chemotherapy with minimal side effects. Her quality of life improved. Her blood sugar levels have been maintained by lifestyle changes and oral hypoglycemics."

This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of normoalbuminuric DKD and identify factors associated with progression. A total of 24,558 patients with type 2 diabetes and no baseline albuminuria were enrolled. Kidney function and albuminuria were monitored. Patients were classified into two groups: the normoalbuminuria group (no albuminuria until estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] declined to 30\u00a0mL\/min\/1.73\u00a0m<sup>2<\/sup>) and the incident albuminuria group (albuminuria developed before eGFR declined below 30). Kidney disease progression, defined as >50\u00a0% eGFR decline or end-stage kidney disease, was compared after propensity score matching. After matching, 6575 patients included per group. Median follow-up was 139\u00a0months (interquartile range, 72-204; maximum, 21\u00a0years). The incident albuminuria group had a higher risk of progression (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.39 [2.05-2.79]). Among normoalbuminuric patients, older age, poor glycemic control, cardiovascular comorbidities, and diuretic use were linked to higher risk, while metformin, statins were protective. Although normoalbuminuria generally indicates favorable prognosis, some patients remain at risk and require close monitoring and individualized care."

        "Abstract":"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often make self-care behaviour decisions according to their immediate needs and desires in the real world. Deviations from optimal choices in seeking satisfying options are known as decision-making biases, which are not obvious in the self-care behaviours of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Qualitative research can provide insights into patients' descriptions of and experiences in self-care, aiding in systematically identifying decision-making biases. To identify the decision-making biases of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from their descriptions of and experiences in self-care to guide targeted strategies for supplementing existing intervention paradigms. Qualitative, descriptive design. We used purposive sampling to recruit 18 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus at the endocrinology outpatient unit of a large urban general hospital in Lanzhou, China, between July and September 2023. We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews to identify decision-making biases of self-care behaviours from the behavioural economics perspective. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the thematic analysis approach was utilized to code the transcribed data and identify themes. We found that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus showed emotion-driven and short-term-oriented decision-making biases regarding self-maintenance. Self-monitoring decisions tend to be personal experiences and based on individual perceptions. Self-management decisions depend heavily on accessibility to and sources of information. Decision-making biases clearly impact the self-care behaviours of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We identified 10 decision-making biases related to self-care behaviour maintenance, monitoring, and management, suggesting that future research can leverage these biases to improve the health-related behaviours of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

This study aims to identify predictors of nonunion in adults treated nonoperatively to optimize treatment decisions and improve outcomes. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 374 patients treated nonoperatively between 2012 and 2024. Patient and fracture characteristics, including age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and fracture comminution, were assessed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses identified predictors of nonunion. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Diagnostic statistics and number needed to screen (NNS) were calculated. Of 374 patients, 72 (19.3 %) developed nonunion. Multivariable analyses revealed that increasing age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.03, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.04, p = 0.002) and smoking (OR: 2.49, 95 % CI: 1.31-4.71, p = 0.005) were independently associated with increased risk of nonunion. Fracture comminution was associated with reduced risk (OR: 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.20-0.58), p < 0.001). The model's AUC was 0.70. At a probability threshold of 0.4, the NNS was 6. This study highlights the potential of predictive models to identify patients at risk for nonunion. Age and smoking increase the risk of nonunion, while comminution showed a protective effect. These findings support personalized care to optimize treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Further refinement and inclusion of additional risk factors are essential to improve the model's accuracy and clinical applicability."

Curcumin, the primary bioactive compound in Curcuma longa (turmeric), has been reported to exhibit several therapeutic effects, including potential benefits for managing DM. However, its clinical use is limited by poor bioavailability. Nanotechnology, particularly nano-curcumin (nCUR), offers a promising solution by enhancing curcumin's delivery and effectiveness. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that nCUR may help manage DM and its complications by reducing oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite these promising results, the exact molecular mechanisms of nCUR remain unclear, and clinical evidence is still limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of global guidelines regulating the use of nanomaterials in medicine. In summary, while nCUR shows strong potential as a therapeutic option for diabetes, further research is necessary to elucidate its mechanisms, confirm its clinical efficacy and safety, and establish standardized guidelines for its use in healthcare."

This study aims to evaluate this risk by synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and characterizing clinical features using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed and Embase up to June 2024 for RCTs reporting genital mycotic infection (GMI) and urinary tract infection (UTI) events associated with SGLT-2is. The primary outcome was the risk of GMI and UTI related to SGLT-2is, quantified using the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, a retrospective pharmacovigilance study of FAERS extracted the cases of genitourinary infections related to SGLT-2is up to June 2024. Disproportionality was calculated using the frequentist and bayesian based data mining algorithms. A total of 98 RCTs (91,756 participants) were included, treatment with SGLT-2is significantly increased the risk of GMI compared to placebo (RR: 3.65, 95% CI: 3.22- 4.14, p\u2009=\u2009<0.0001) and active control (RR: 4.29; 95% CI: 3.42-5.38, p\u2009=\u2009<0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed significant differences by individual drug, gender, and duration. Disproportionality analysis revealed significant signals for all SGLT-2is with genitourinary tract infections, persisting after signal refinement. SGLT-2is significantly increase the risk of GMI among T2DM patients, while the association with UTI remains inconsistent. Additional research is required to elucidate the potential risk factors."

Globally, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome ranged from 12.5-31.4\u00a0%, among which 5-7\u00a0% were young adults. Environmental factors, nutrition, and genetic and epigenetic predispositions are thought to interact intricately to cause metabolic disease. MicroRNAs are short, small non-coding RNAs that attach to the target coding sequences and untranslated genomic regions in many cell types, thereby post-transcriptionally suppressing gene expression. The human genome contains around 2000 microRNAs many of which appear linked to a numerous biologic and pathophysiologic processes, such as inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. Many human disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disorders, have been linked to deregulated microRNA expression. More recently, the identification of extracellular microRNAs has highlighted their potential as markers of disease and endocrine signaling molecules. This review provides an overview of microRNA biogenesis and its function in insulin signaling, adipogenesis, biology of pancreatic \u03b2-cell, and metabolism.

The weighted mean (standard deviation (SD)) level of SUA and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were 5.74 (1.58) mg\/dL and 62.51 (27.80) nmol\/L, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 6.83\u00b14.63 years, and 1967 deaths were documented. The all-cause and CVD mortality rates per 1000 person-year among DM patients were 28.30 and 9.49, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, patients with HUA and SVDD exhibited the higher risk of all-cause [HR: 1.28 (1.09-1.50) for HUA and 1.44 (1.07-1.94) for SVDD] and CVD [HR: 11.54 (1.01-2.36) for HUA and 1.98(1.19-3.28) for SVDD] mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated a statistically significant difference in survival probability over different HUA and SVDD categories among DM patients. The joint analysis revealed that HUA and SVDD have a joint effect on all-cause mortality [HR: 1.90 (1.23-2.93)] and CVD mortality [HR: 2.60 (1.45-4.65)] among patients with DM. Sensitivity analysis, propensity score matching and stratified analyses confirmed the stability of the research results. Mediation analyses further revealed that 11.4% of the SUA-mortality association was mediated through SIRI, and 1.96% of the 25(OH)D-mortality association through glycated hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c). HUA and SVDD comorbidity is significantly associated with elevated risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in DM patients. These findings indicate that concurrent management of HUA and SVDD may improve prognosis of DM patients."

        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may increase the risk of suboptimal neurocognitive development in infants. Maternal supply of omega-3 and -6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), including eicosapentaeonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, are critical for offspring brain development. To study the effects of GDM on offspring brain fatty acid composition, C57BL\/6J mice were exposed to short-term high-fat diet feeding and low-dose streptozotocin treatments before pregnancy. Maternal blood glucose levels positively correlated to offspring brain omega 6:omega 3 ratio at postnatal day 2 and day 21, which appeared to be driven specifically by higher omega-6 LCPUFA levels. GDM may be associated with impaired brain fatty acid profile in offspring, and this may underpin altered neurodevelopmental outcomes after GDM pregnancies. These findings support further investigation into the therapeutic potential of postnatal dietary interventions targeting fatty acid status in infants born after GDM."

        "Abstract":"Individuals with diabetes are often prescribed standard of care accommodative insoles to provide extra cushioning and prevent ulcers. Our pressure-based 3D printed custom accommodative insoles have proven effective in reducing plantar pressure in individuals with diabetes. Given that older adults with diabetes have exacerbated balance deficits due to neuropathy, it is essential to examine the impact of these custom accommodative insoles on postural balance in individuals with diabetes. Therefore, the purpose is to examine the effects of custom accommodative insoles on balance during quiet standing in individuals with diabetes. Standard of care and pressure-based 3D printed custom accommodative insoles were designed from foot impressions obtained from ten participants with diabetes. Postural balance was assessed during quiet standing for three conditions: no insole, standard of care, and pressure-based 3D printed custom accommodative insoles. Center of pressure measures were computed for all three conditions, and differences between the three insole conditions were evaluated. There were no significant differences in the center of pressure measures across the insole conditions. Use of standard of care and pressure-based 3D printed custom accommodative insoles did not negatively affect the postural balance during quiet standing compared to the no insole condition. This pilot study provides useful information on how the custom accommodative insoles used to prevent ulcers in individuals with diabetes affect postural balance. Static postural balance is not adversely impacted with the use of custom accommodative insoles in individuals with diabetes."

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients, and then in symptomatic versus asymptomatic diabetics. Diabetic individuals are at increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis. A significant percentage of diabetics fail to perceive the typical symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Screening methods such as coronary computed tomography (CCTA) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have not shown clear benefits in asymptomatic diabetics. The role of stress CMR in this population is not well established. Between 2008 and 2018, all consecutive diabetic and non-diabetic patients without known cardiovascular disease referred for stress perfusion CMR in two tertiary centers were included. Propensity-score matching was used to create a cohort of diabetic versus non-diabetic patients with similar baseline characteristics. All patients were followed for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Diabetic patients were categorized into symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Out of 3,485 eligible patients, 1,359 diabetics and 1,359 non-diabetics (mean age 69\u00b112 years, 57.4% women) with similar propensity scores were included. Over a median follow-up period of 6.5 (5.9-8.9) years, 386 (14.2%) experienced MACEs. Kaplan-Meier analysis for the occurrence of MACE indicated that the extent of ischemia or late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) involving \u2265 3 segments were independent predictors of the occurrence of MACEs (hazard ratio, HR: 7.14 [95% CI, 5.01-10.02]; and HR: 5.03 [95% CI, 3.47-7.29]; both p<0.001, respectively), with no significant differences between diabetics and non-diabetics. Asymptomatic diabetics (n=255) showed similar event rates as symptomatic patients (p=0.98). Stress CMR provides valuable prognostic information in diabetic patients, irrespective of symptoms. Further assessment is needed to determine whether stress CMR should be a standard screening tool for diabetic patients."

        "Abstract":"The global incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is rapidly rising, and DM worsens renal ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury, a major cause of high-mortality acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, preventing renal I\/R injury in DM is crucial. Platycodin D (PD), a compound from Platycodon grandiflorum roots, is known to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Numerous studies have demonstrated that AMPK activation has protective effects in diabetes mellitus (DM) and ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury. However, the impact of PD on renal I\/R injury in DM and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our experiments revealed that PD treatment via gavage significantly alleviated kidney tissue damage and cell apoptosis in diabetic renal I\/R injury. Additionally, PD reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated a notable discovery in mitophagosome formation. The expression levels of P-AMPK, light chain 3B (LC3B)-II, PTEN-induced putative protein kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin all increased under PD treatment, while sequestosome 1 (P62) level decreased. Importantly, AMPK antagonist Compound C (CC) abolished these effects. Additionally, our transcriptomic profiling revealed that PD treatment significantly suppressed MAPK\/NF-\u03baB signaling activation. Through functional rescue experiments, we mechanistically demonstrated that PD-mediated AMPK phosphorylation governs this regulatory axis. AMPK inhibition abolished PD's effects on both MAPK\/NF-\u03baB suppression, establishing AMPK activation as the upstream modulator. Overall, PD may reduce renal I\/R injury in DM through AMPK\/PINK1\/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and inhibiting MAPK\/NF-\u03baB pathway."

A total of 21,401 women without pre-existing diabetes were enrolled in a prospective birth cohort study conducted in China. The participants were categorized into four groups based on their METS-IR index scores. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the first trimester METS-IR and CHD in their offspring. Mediation analysis was conducted to determine if GDM mediates this association. The increase in the METS-IR index in the first trimester was positively correlated with a significantly increased risk of CHD in offspring. Compared with the low METS-IR level group, the CHD risk in the high METS-IR group increased by 40\u202f%. There was a positive linear dose-response relationship between METS-IR and CHD risk. Joint exposure to GDM and an elevated first-trimester METS-IR index significantly increased the risk of CHD in offspring, with evidence of a synergistic interaction on both multiplicative and additive scales. The estimated mediation proportion was 20.15\u202f%. The first-trimester METS-IR index was associated with an increased risk of CHD, and GDM partially mediated the association between the METS-IR index in the first trimester and CHD."

The specific risk factors for DBD remain poorly understood due to inconsistent findings in prior studies. This study aims to systematically identify the risk factors associated with DBD among Chinese T2DM patients. A case-control study was conducted in Shenzhen, China, spanning from March 2019 to January 2024, involving T2DM patients from two tertiary comprehensive hospitals. Patients were categorized into DBD and non-DBD groups based on DBD presence or absence. Comparative analysis utilized the Mann-Whitney U test and \u03c7<sup>2<\/sup> test, with significant variables subsequently subjected to logistic regression analysis. In this study, 35.5% of patients with T2DM experienced the outcome of DBD. Comparative analysis between DBD and non-DBD groups revealed that 11 of 60 candidate variables demonstrated significant associations with DBD development (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Significant predictors identified in logistic regression included age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04), gender (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.72), duration of T2DM (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.11), urine microalbumin\/creatinine ratio (UA\/CR) (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.01), and insulin use (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.30-3.96).

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a control group enrolled patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy at a private hospital in Kayseri, Turkey between June 2023 and September 2023. A total of 93 patients were enrolled, 46 in the experimental group and 47 in the control group. The experimental group implemented the SSI prevention care bundle, while the control group received standard care. Data were collected in three phases: (1) preoperatively, (2) postoperatively until discharge, and (3) on day 30 postoperatively, with the final phase conducted by telephone. Comfort was measured within the first 8\u00a0h after surgery. Physiological parameters were assessed at all time points, and biochemical outcomes were monitored pre- and postoperatively. The study demonstrated a reduction in the superficial SSI rate from 7.52% in the control group to 2.15% in the intervention group (p\u2009=\u20090.074). The results suggest a marginally significant trend toward reduced SSIs in the intervention group. The intervention group showed a slightly higher comfort score. Identified risk factors for SSI included smoking, alcohol use, drainage, low preoperative hemoglobin, total bilirubin\u2009>\u20091, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among hyperglycemic patients, SSI occurred in 4 out of 18 patients in the control group, whereas normoglycemia was achieved in 12 hyperglycemic patients in the intervention group, with no cases of SSI observed (p\u2009>\u20090.05). SSI bundle implementation lowered infection rates and improved comfort. This article followed the CONSORT 2010 checklist guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials.

Leveraging data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021, we analyse epidemiological trends (1990-2021) and project disease trajectories to 2040, focusing on sociodemographic disparities and metabolic determinants. <b>Methods<\/b> Utilising GBD 2021 data, the estimated prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) values were extracted for SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM, along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). The trend in SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM burden between 1990 and 2021 was evaluated from both a global and local perspective. Subgroup analysis was employed to examine the burden of SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM across various subpopulations. Additionally, decomposition analysis was used to assess the contributions of population size, age structure, and epidemiological changes to SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM burden. The Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model and the Nordpred model projected the burden through 2040. <b>Results<\/b> In 2021, the prevalence of SHF-CKD-T1DM was 5723 (95% UI: 4397 to 7284) and SHF-CKD-T2DM was 122,404 (95% UI: 89,920 to 169,580). The age-standardised years lived with disability (YLDs) rates for SHF-CKD-T1DM in 2021 exhibited a significant increase to 0.012 (95% UI: 0.008 to 0.019), while YLDs rates for SHF-CKD-T2DM also showed a notable rise to 0.249 (95% UI: 0.146 to 0.394). The global burden of SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM showed variability across different sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. In 2021, the overall burden of SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM continued to increase, with age being a significant contributor. Similarly, SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM burden exhibited gender-specific variability. Decomposition analysis indicated that epidemiological changes were the primary contributors to the global burden of prevalence and YLDs associated with SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM. It is projected that by 2040, the trends in prevalence and YLDs will stabilise; however, they are expected to continue rising. <b>Conclusion<\/b> The increasing burden of SHF-CKD-T1\/T2DM is driven by epidemiological transitions, population growth, and regional disparities. Although growth rates have decelerated, the rising number of cases highlights the urgent need for targeted prevention and early intervention strategies in high-risk populations. To alleviate this burden, it is essential to address metabolic determinants, improve healthcare access in regions with high prevalence, expand diabetes treatment coverage in low-SDI regions, and incorporate cardiorenal risk stratification into diabetes management frameworks."

Special emphasis was placed on examining early and chronic phases of gliosis, assessing molecular markers of glial activation, and determining whether sorafenib can attenuate glial remodelling and neuroinflammation in the diabetic retina. Materials and Methods: Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: untreated diabetic controls, insulin-treated, and insulin + sorafenib-treated. Diabetic retinopathy was induced via intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg\/kg). Retinal samples were collected at 7, 14, 28 days, and 3 months post-induction. Histological analysis (H&E staining), immunohistochemistry (GFAP, S100), and Western blotting (GFAP, Iba-1) were used to assess glial activation. Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: Untreated diabetic rats exhibited severe retinal oedema, neurodegeneration, and increased GFAP, S100, and Iba-1 expression, indicating pronounced macroglial and microglial activation. Sorafenib co-treatment significantly reduced the expression of glial markers and preserved retinal structure, with near-complete suppression of gliosis and no evidence of glial-mesenchymal transition. These effects were more pronounced than those of insulin monotherapy. Conclusions: Sorafenib attenuates retinal glial activation and neuroinflammatory changes in experimental diabetic retinopathy, suggesting its potential as a neuroprotective and antifibrotic agent. Targeted kinase inhibition may represent a promising adjunct strategy in early-stage disease management."

Before propensity score (PS) matching, 13,019 colchicine users and 111,594 NSAIDs users were included in the study cohort (mean age, 65.5 vs. 62.9; 35.0% vs. 29.8% female). After 1:2 PS matching, 12,908 colchicine users and 25,816 NSAIDs users remained (mean age, 65.7 vs. 65.7 years; 35.2% vs. 35.1% female). The PS-matched hazard ratio for MACE was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.65-1.36), and all secondary outcomes also resulted in null findings. Use of colchicine does not significantly reduce the risk of MACE compared with NSAIDs in a real-world population with T2DM and gout in South Korea between 2011 and 2022."

        "Title":"Advancements in Pharmacotherapy for Diabetic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review.",
        "Abstract":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), affecting 20-40% of individuals with diabetes, is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease and represents a considerable global public health challenge owing to its high morbidity and mortality rates. Although traditional DKD management has focused on renin-angiotensin system blockade, the residual risk of renal failure persists despite optimised therapy. New therapeutic drugs, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, have triggered a paradigm shift in DKD treatment. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and selective endothelin receptor antagonists have shown notable efficacy in improving renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with its holistic approach and evidence-based refinements, has shown considerable promise in DKD treatment, particularly as its theoretical framework continues to evolve. This study highlighted the transformative potential of multitargeted strategies in mitigating DKD progression, improving cardiovascular outcomes, and alleviating healthcare burdens. Future research should prioritise standardised trials, long-term safety assessments of TCM and personalised therapeutic regimens to optimise clinical management and patient quality of life."

        "Title":"Electroacupuncture at ST36 improves gastrointestinal motility disorders by promoting enteric nervous system regeneration through GDNF\/Ret signaling in diabetic mice.",
        "Abstract":"Diabetes-induced gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders are increasingly prevalent. Damage to the enteric nervous system (ENS), composed primarily of enteric neurons and glial cells, is an essential mechanism involved in these disorders. Although electroacupuncture (EA) has shown the potential to mitigate enteric neuronal loss, its mechanism is not fully understood. Additionally, the effects of EA on enteric glial cells have not been investigated. Enteric neural precursor cells (ENPCs) contribute to the structural and functional integrity of the ENS, yet whether EA enhances their differentiation into enteric neurons and glial cells remains unexplored. This study investigates whether EA promotes ENS repair through enhancing ENPC-derived neurogenesis and gliogenesis and elucidates the potential molecular mechanisms involved. Transgenic mice were used to trace Nestin<sup>+<\/sup>\/nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr)<sup>+<\/sup> ENPCs labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in vivo. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, diabetes mellitus (DM), DM\u00a0+\u00a0sham EA, and DM\u00a0+\u00a0EA. The effects of EA on diabetic mice were evaluated by GI motility, ENS structure, and ENPC differentiation. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)\/Ret signaling was detected to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms. EA alleviated diabetes-induced GI motility disorders, as indicated by reduced whole gut transit time, shortened colonic bead expulsion time, and enhanced smooth muscle contractility. Furthermore, EA attenuated diabetes-induced losses of enteric neurons and glial cells, thereby restoring ENS integrity. Notably, EA reversed the diabetes-induced decrease in ENPCs and significantly increased the absolute number and the proportion of ENPC-derived enteric neurons. However, immunofluorescence analyses revealed no colocalization between EA-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)<sup>+<\/sup> glial cells and GFP-labeled ENPCs. Mechanistically, GDNF\/Ret signaling was elevated in intestinal tissues and upregulated in ENPCs in EA-treated diabetic mice. EA facilitates ENS repair by promoting Nestin<sup>+<\/sup>\/Ngfr<sup>+<\/sup> ENPC differentiation into enteric neurons via upregulation of GDNF\/Ret signaling, and driving enteric gliogenesis from non-Nestin<sup>+<\/sup>\/Ngfr<sup>+<\/sup> ENPCs. These findings highlight EA's role in ameliorating diabetes-induced GI dysmotility through ENPC-derived ENS restoration. Please cite this article as: Guo JL, Liu S, Ding SJ, Yang X, Du F.

        "Abstract":"People with type 1 diabetes require ongoing self-management and frequent follow-up care. Digital care models might offer flexible solutions and increased sustainability, and while the clinical opportunities of these care models have been explored, the characteristics of patients inclined to opt for digital care remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate which selected sociodemographic and disease-related patient characteristics are associated with opting for digital outpatient care among patients with type 1 diabetes. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the endocrinology department of Akershus University Hospital in Norway, as part of a larger longitudinal study. Adult patients with type 1 diabetes were eligible to participate and were recruited consecutively. Patients could choose either a novel, mobile health-based, digital, tailored, outpatient care model (DigiDiaS care) or continuation of usual care. DigiDiaS care is delivered via an app comprising a message service; preconsultation questionnaires; options for physical, video, or telephone consultations; an information page; and an e-learning course. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from the participants' medical records and the national diabetes registry. Self-reported data comprised self-management measured using the Patient Activation Measure 13 (PAM-13), diabetes distress (20-item Problem Areas in Diabetes; PAID-20), well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index; WHO-5), and health literacy (12-item short version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire; HLS-19 Q12) questionnaires. We explored group differences and conducted logistic regression to identify factors associated with opting for DigiDiaS care versus usual care. A total of 237 patients consented to participate in the study, with 185 (78.1%) opting for DigiDiaS care and 52 (21.9%) opting for usual care. The DigiDiaS care group had a statistically significantly shorter duration of diabetes (median 19, range 0-51 years) compared with the usual care group (median 29, range 3-58 years; P<.001); higher proportions of users of insulin pumps than insulin pens for insulin delivery (DigiDiaS care: 74\/185, 40%; usual care: 12\/185, 23.1%; P=.007), and a lower median well-being care score (DigiDiaS care: median score 60, range 4-96; usual care: median score 68, range 16-100; P=.04). The DigiDiaS care and usual care groups did not differ in sociodemographic variables, presence of late complications from diabetes or comorbidities, self-management, diabetes distress, or health literacy. This study reveals that most patients with type 1 diabetes choose digital outpatient care when it is offered. Our study suggests that those opting for DigiDiaS care are already familiar with using diabetes-related technology, have a shorter diabetes duration, and have lower well-being. It is essential to understand the characteristics of patients who opt for usual care to ensure high-quality health care services. Further studies should also focus on how the implementation of digital solutions in outpatient care can affect how and if patients use them. RR2-10.2196\/52766."

        "Abstract":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are now the mainstay treatment for many chronic conditions including diabetes mellitus, obesity, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. GLP-1 RAs may affect bowel preparation for a colonoscopy by modifying intestinal motility and gastric emptying. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RA use on bowel preparation quality, measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), and the frequency of inadequate preparation events. Multiple databases were searched for studies investigating the impact of GLP-1 RA on bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Primary end points included bowel preparation quality, measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), and the frequency of inadequate preparation events. Random-effects model was used for statistical analysis. Six studies were included in the final meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the pooled rate of inadequate bowel preparation events between the GLP-1 RA group and the control group (OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.73-1.37, P = 0.99, I<sup>2<\/sup> = 33%).

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) may have neuroprotective effects beyond glucose control, but evidence remains limited. This study aimed to assess whether SGLT2i use is associated with a lower incidence of dementia compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) in older adults with T2DM. This retrospective cohort study used data from the IQVIA\u2122 Disease Analyzer database in Germany. Patients aged \u226560\u202fyears with T2DM, receiving metformin and newly prescribed SGLT2i or DPP-4i (2012-2022), were included. Those with prior neurodegenerative diagnoses were excluded. Propensity score matching (1:1) and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for dementia over five years. After matching, 38,140 patients were included. Dementia incidence was lower in the SGLT2i group (5.4\u202f%) than the DPP-4i group (6.4\u202f%) (p\u202f=\u202f0.002). SGLT2i use was linked to a 20\u202f% reduced dementia risk (HR: 0.80; 95\u202f% CI: 0.70-0.93; p\u202f=\u202f0.002), especially in patients >80\u202fyears (HR: 0.75) and males (HR: 0.77).

        "Abstract":"As one of the most serious chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) have a complex pathogenesis involving multiple factors such as persistent hyperglycemia-induced microangiopathy, chronic inflammatory state and oxidative stress injury. Regenerative medicine strategies of stem cells have brought new hope for DFUs treatment, among which adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have attracted much attention due to their easy accessibility, multidirectional differentiation potential and paracrine function. However, excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the high-glucose microenvironment can trigger mitochondrial dysfunction and premature senescence of ADSCs, which greatly reduce their therapeutic efficacy. To address this critical issue, this study innovatively constructed a Selenium nanoparticles\/Chitosan\/Cellulose nanofibers (SeNPs@CS-CNFs) self-healing hydrogel system. The hydrogel integrates: antimicrobial and epidermal regeneration benefits of chitosan; the three-dimensional porous network structure formed by cellulose nanofibers, and reduction-synthesized SeNPs scavenge ROS by GPX-mimicking activity. Its self-healing ability ensures structural stability during wound healing. In vitro, the SeNPs@CS-CNFs@ADSCs hydrogel significantly enhanced cell migration. In vivo experiments showed that SeNPs@CS-CNFs@ADSCs hydrogel significantly accelerated the healing of whole skin defects in diabetic rats, promoted collagen deposition and neovascularization, and exhibited good anti-inflammatory effects. This innovative multifunctional hydrogel presents a promising DFUs treatment strategy with clinical potential."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM)-a myocardial pathology that is both singular and independent of coronary artery disease and hypertension-constitutes an intrinsically specific cardiac alteration in individuals with diabetes mellitus, whose labyrinthine pathogenesis portends profound compromise of ventricular performance and existential quality of life. In recent years, studies have found that DNA methylation and oxidative stress are closely related to the occurrence and development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. DNA methylation participates in the oxidative damage, metabolic abnormalities, and apoptosis of myocardial cells by regulating the expression of key antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory factors, and mitochondrial function-related genes. Oxidative stress can alter the methylation profile of myocardial cells and exacerbate pathological conditions by activating mechanisms such as DNA methyltransferase. The interaction between the two constitutes an important molecular regulatory axis in diabetes cardiomyopathy. Centering on the intersecting mechanisms of DNA methylation and oxidative stress in diabetic cardiomyopathy, this review dissects their concerted roles in suppressing antioxidant enzyme expression, derailing mitochondrial function, igniting inflammatory cascades, and precipitating cardiomyocyte apoptosis, while systematically enumerating current intervention strategies targeting these pathways-spanning natural products, epigenetic modulators, and antioxidant therapies-with the overarching objective of furnishing both theoretical scaffolding and translational reference for mechanistic inquiry and precision therapeutics in diabetic cardiomyopathy."

        "Abstract":"With the increasing global burden of type 2 diabetes, prevention strategies that target prediabetes, a state of hyperglycaemia that puts individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes, are required. We aimed to estimate global rates of transition from prediabetes to normoglycaemia or type 2 diabetes, stratified by age, sex, and race and ethnicity. We also aimed to quantify the effect of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors on these transitions. In this pooled analysis of individual-level data, we included original data from 19 prospective cohort studies conducted in Asia (Iran and Japan), Australia, Europe (Spain and Sweden), North America (USA and Mexico), and South America (Venezuela). We applied discrete-time hidden Markov models to estimate rates and ratios of prediabetes transitions to type 2 diabetes and normoglycaemia specific to age, sex, and race and ethnicity. We used Fine-Gray competing risk models to derive cohort-specific subhazard ratios (SHRs) for potential risk factors influencing these transitions. We subsequently pooled these SHRs using a random-effects meta-analysis. In subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and recruitment period, we used multivariate Cox models to investigate the degree of heterogeneity between studies. 76 092 participants (39\u2008842 [52\u00b73%] women and 36\u2008250 [47\u00b76%] men; mean age 51\u00b71 years [SD 12\u00b77]) with available data on glycaemic status from at least one follow-up visit were included in the analysis, of whom 56\u2008837 (74\u00b77%) had normoglycaemia and 19\u2008255 (25\u00b73%) had prediabetes. Median follow-up was 9\u00b78 years (IQR 5\u00b78-12\u00b75). Within 10 years, individuals with prediabetes had a 12\u00b75% probability of progressing to type 2 diabetes, whereas the probability of reverting to normoglycaemia was 36\u00b71%. However, in the highest fasting plasma glucose quartile, the probability of progression increased to 16\u00b71% and reversion decreased to 13\u00b74%. Male sex, older age (\u226555 years), and Latinx populations were associated with an increased risk of transitioning to type 2 diabetes. Risk factors that significantly reduced prediabetes reversion to normoglycaemia were overweight (SHR 0\u00b788 [95% CI 0\u00b776-0\u00b799]), obesity (0\u00b766 [0\u00b752-0\u00b781]), elevated waist-to-height ratio (0\u00b782 [0\u00b770-0\u00b795]), elevated waist-to-hip ratio (0\u00b779 [0\u00b768-0\u00b791]), and reduced HDL concentration (0\u00b772 [0\u00b759-0\u00b784]). Our findings highlight that reversion to normoglycaemia was more common than progression to type 2 diabetes among individuals with prediabetes, and that these transitions were strongly influenced by modifiable risk factors. The increased risk of progression with advancing age and among men underscores the importance of early identification and targeted interventions in population groups at high risk of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the elevated progression risk in individuals with higher fasting plasma glucose concentrations at baseline reinforces the need for timely detection and intervention during this crucial clinical window.

GPR120, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in metabolic regulation, has emerged as a promising target; however, potent agonists are still scarce, underscoring the need for new candidates. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of flavone and isoflavone derivatives to identify potent GPR120 agonists. Among 16 derivatives, 4',5,7-trimethoxyflavone (15) exhibited the highest potency with an EC\u2085\u2080 of 0.6\u00a0\u03bcM. Biological assays revealed that 15 significantly enhanced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through GPR120-mediated AMPK phosphorylation and reduced adipogenesis by modulating early differentiation markers. Furthermore, in a zebrafish larva model, 15 influenced the expression of pre-insulin markers, indicating systemic metabolic effects. Notably, 15 also demonstrated potent PPAR\u03b3 antagonist activity, highlighting its dual role in modulating key metabolic pathways. These findings support 15 as a promising lead for developing safer, dual-acting therapeutics for T2DM and metabolic syndrome."

The global increase in T2DM due to high-fat diets necessitates urgent research into the pathogenesis and precision treatments for high-fat-induced DR. Emerging clinical evidence of liver-retina crosstalk offers new mechanistic insights, while the underlying network of metabolites and secreted proteins within the liver-retina axis in high-fat diets induced retinopathy remains unclear. Here, we induced early retinopathy in mice with high-fat diet for 5 weeks, resulting in shortened retinal rods and elevated inflammatory factors, increased activation of microglia and shortened retinal rods. Integrated analysis of RNA-seq data from the retina and liver showed coordinated changes in retinol metabolism pathway and gene networks. Metabolomics and hepatokine analysis suggest that certain liver metabolites (e.g., betaine) and factors (e.g., FGF21) exhibit shared change profiles with the retina under retinal inflammation, uncovering a potential hepatic-ocular network in high-fat-induced DR. This study provides novel insights into distant organ regulation network and identifies potential therapeutic targets for early retinopathy associated with diet-induced metabolic stress, advancing precision treatments strategies."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes screening is one of the simpler methods for preventing and lowering the disease's morbidity and mortality. Screening for gestational diabetes is a crucial component of obstetric care, as it negatively affects the life of both the mother and the fetus. There is a high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and tobacco use in Lesotho. This highlights the significance of bolstering prevention and treatment initiatives in the country. Therefore, this study is intended to assess diabetes screening and its associated factors among women aged 15-49 years using the 2023-24 Lesotho demographic and health survey dataset. A cross-sectional study was employed using data from the most recent national representative dataset. A total sample of 3,297 women aged between 15 and 49 years was included in the study. Data extracted from the Lesotho Demographic and Health Survey 2023-24 data sets were cleaned, recoded, and analyzed using STATA\/SE version 14.0 statistical software. Multilevel logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with the outcome variable. Finally, variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were declared statistically significant. In the current study, 29.18% (95% CI: 27.65%-30.75%) of women aged 15-49 years in Lesotho were screened for diabetes mellitus. Of these, 1.40% of them had high blood sugar or diabetes, and 54.35% of women were diagnosed in the last twelve months. Age of respondents [AOR\u2009=\u20093.53; 95% CI (2.80, 4.46)], maternal occupation [AOR\u2009=\u20091.38; 95% CI (1.15, 1.65)], wealth status [AOR\u2009=\u20091.43; 95% CI (1.07, 1.91)], and visiting a healthcare facility in the last 12 months [AOR\u2009=\u20091.31; 95% CI (1.09, 1.57)] were statistically significantly associated with diabetes screening. Less than one in three women aged 15 to 49 years were screened for diabetes in Lesotho. Advanced age, working women, wealthier households, and visiting a healthcare facility in the last 12 months were associated with higher odds of diabetes screening. Therefore, women's empowerment, regular visits to healthcare facilities, and awareness creation for young women are recommended to improve diabetes screening practices among women."

        "Abstract":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), with insulin resistance (IR) increasingly recognized as a key contributor. The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), a surrogate marker of insulin sensitivity, has been proposed as a predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in T1DM. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between eGDR and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was conducted through March 6, 2025, to identify studies reporting multivariable-adjusted risk estimates linking eGDR with cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with T1DM. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using random-effects models with the Paule-Mandel method and Knapp-Hartung adjustment. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore potential effect modifiers, and leave-one-out (LOO) sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of findings. Sixteen studies comprising 29,075 individuals with T1DM were included. Higher eGDR was significantly associated with lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality, with hazard ratios per unit increase of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72-0.87; I\u00b2 = 63%) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86; I\u00b2 = 0%), respectively. Lower eGDR was also associated with increased risk of CAD (low vs. high eGDR: HR 3.61; 95% CI: 2.83-4.62; I\u00b2 = 0%). Subgroup analyses suggested a stronger protective association between eGDR and MACE among older individuals (\u2265\u200940 years), those with BMI\u2009<\u200925\u00a0kg\/m\u00b2, and those with longer diabetes duration (\u2265\u200920 years). LOO sensitivity analyses showed that CAD was the only outcome influenced by exclusion of the largest study. Lower eGDR is consistently associated with increased risk of MACE, CAD, and all-cause mortality in individuals with T1DM. These findings support the utility of eGDR as a practical, non-invasive marker for cardiovascular risk stratification in this high-risk population."

Head CT or MRI examination showed aspergillous abscess, which is extremely rare to caused meningitis alone. We report a case of aspergillosis meningitis with short-term death. We utilized the DNBSEQ\u2122 sequencing platform, which employs DNA nanoballs (DNBs) technology. Briefly, DNBs are arrayed on a patterned flow cell, where DNA polymerase catalyzes the incorporation of fluorescently labeled nucleotides during sequencing-by-synthesis. The emitted fluorescence signals are digitally captured and computationally processed to generate high-accuracy base sequence data. A 51-year-old woman with a medical history of post-hepatitis B cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thyroid carcinoma presented with acute-onset altered mental status. Physical examination revealed positive meningeal signs. Initial neuroimaging studies, including two serial head CT scans and two MRI examinations, showed no evidence of fungal abscess formation in the brain parenchyma. The diagnosis of <i>A. fumigatus<\/i> meningitis was confirmed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and galactomannan (GM) testing. Despite prompt initiation of voriconazole therapy, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, resulting in death after 10 days of treatment. <i>A. fumigatus<\/i> meningitis represents a rare but life-threatening infection characterized by diagnostic challenges and alarmingly high mortality rates. Stringent diagnostic vigilance is essential to avoid diagnostic errors in these cases. The PMseq-DR platform, a high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technology for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, provides a valuable diagnostic tool for rapid pathogen identification. For patients presenting with meningitis of unknown etiology following conventional diagnostic workup (including microbial culture, galactomannan assay, and 1-3-\u03b2-D-glucan testing), comprehensive CSF pathogen analysis becomes critical. In such scenarios, prompt implementation of high-throughput sequencing is recommended to enable accurate diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention."

A total of 150 subjects were enrolled, including 130 T2DM patients and 20 healthy controls. T2DM patients were divided into two groups based on HbA1c levels: well-controlled group (HbA1c\u2009<\u20097.0%, n\u2009=\u200965) and poorly-controlled group (HbA1c\u2009\u2265\u20097.0%, n\u2009=\u200965). All subjects underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) for corneal nerve analysis and infrared meibography for meibomian gland evaluation. Disease duration, medication history, and microvascular complications were recorded for all diabetic patients. Age-related meibomian gland changes were controlled by age-matching between groups. Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), and meibomian gland parameters were measured and compared among groups. Correlation analysis was performed between HbA1c levels and ocular surface parameters. Compared with the healthy control group, T2DM patients showed significantly reduced CNFD, CNBD, CNFL, and increased meibomian gland dropout (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). These parameters were significantly worse in the poorly-controlled group compared to the well-controlled group (all P\u2009<\u20090.01).

Corneal nerve fiber and meibomian gland morphology are significantly correlated with HbA1c levels in T2DM patients. These ocular surface changes may serve as early, non-invasive biomarkers for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and could potentially be incorporated into routine diabetic follow-up examinations. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish the causality and evaluate the clinical significance of these findings for individualized ocular surface management in diabetic patients."

Two hundred and forty-four adult type 2 diabetics selected using systematic sampling were recruited into the study. A semi- structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on sociodemographic characteristics and CAM use. Data obtained was analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version 23). Statistical analyses were significant at p< 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. The mean age \u00b1 standard deviation was 56.97 \u00b110.69 years. Overall CAM use was 40.1%. The highest proportion of CAM use was among those aged between 30 - 40 years (52.9%). Most of the CAM users (71.4%) had uncontrolled fasting blood glucose. Moringa was the most used CAM 61(34.4%). Those who did not use CAM (OR=1.95, CI= 1.12 - 3.37, p<0.05) were 1.95 times more likely to have controlled FBG, and was statistically significant. Many of the diabetic patients used CAM and most of those who practiced concurrent use of CAM and orthodox medicine had poor glycaemic control. Developing a patient-centred approach to CAM use through health education, community engagement, workshops for CAM providers and strengthening health system will reduce reliance on CAM."

        "Title":"Risk of Insufficient Hydroxyvitamin D Levels in Diabetic Foot Ulcers in Rivers State Nigeria.",
        "Abstract":"The global increase in diabetes, especially in developing nations, has escalated complications like diabetic foot ulcers. Hypovitaminosis D is considerably prevalent among individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and chronic vascular complications. The aim of this study was to determine the association between vitamin D levels and foot ulcers among patients with T2DM. This study population comprised 88 individuals with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and 88 individuals with T2DM without DFUs. Vitamin D levels were assayed using blood samples according to standard methods. An independent t-test was done to analyze the difference between serum vitamin D levels in both groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis were also performed. Majority of participants in the DFU group presented with Grade 2 and Grade 3 ulcers (Wagner's classification). There was a significant difference in serum vitamin D levels, indicating lower levels among cases (mean of 19.6 ng\/ml \u00b1 13.6) compared to controls (mean of 36.2 ng\/ml \u00b1 11.4) with a p-value of 0.014. Data shows 84.1% of persons with foot ulcers had deficient\/insufficient serum vitamin D levels, while only 29.5% persons without DFU had deficient\/insufficient vitamin D levels. Regression analysis shows that persons with DFU were 12.6 (6.0 - 26.2) times likely to have deficient\/insufficient vitamin D levels. Chi-square analysis shows that the distribution of the DFU severity was significantly higher among persons with deficient serum Vitamin D levels (p = 0.0001). Lower serum vitamin D levels are significantly associated with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Screening for and correcting vitamin D deficiency may potentially improve the outcome in patients with diabetic foot ulcers."

        "Abstract":"Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in the gut microbiome should play a critical role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes and its complication such as diabetic nephropathy (DN). Nevertheless, a considerable gap remains in our understanding of the interconnection between DN pathogenesis and gut microbiota arrangement. In this context, this review highlights recent research on the connection between the intestinal microbiota and DN risk, with a particular focus on the role of microbial metabolites in disease development. It also highlights recent advancements in metagenomic analyses of gut microbial communities and their potential contribution to the progression of DN. Further, it describes the challenges associated with the metagenomics-based analysis of intestinal microbiota and the advancement of therapeutics for DN. An exploration of the surveyed literature reveals the lack of any definitive correlation between gut microbiota and DN transition, even when assessed in view of widespread geographical and ethnic diversity. Future research in this domain should be conducted to address various issues like increasing the number of participants, intake patient diversity, logistical difficulties, and racial disparities. A critical assessment of these parameters will help improve our understanding of the potential contribution of gut microbiota to the DN progression."

        "Abstract":"This study investigated the liver composition in diabetic-induced mice after photobiomodulation (PBM) treatment using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to identify potential molecular alterations. Tissue biopsies were removed from the left lobes of rat livers. Each biopsy was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C for NMR analysis. For this purpose, a spectrometer was used operating at 600\u00a0MHz, with a temperature of 295\u00a0K and a rotation rate of 5\u00a0kHz on 15 animals. Of these, 10 rats were induced with streptozotocin injection and the remaining 5 were injected with saline solution. Sixty days after diabetes induction, the animals were randomly divided into three groups: the Sham group (n\u2009=\u20095); group A (non-treated diabetic-induced rats, n\u2009=\u20095); and group B (diabetic-induced rats treated with LED at 850\u00a0nm, 48 mW, 22\u00a0s, 1.0\u00a0J, n\u2009=\u20095) in the liver region. The results showed that PBM modulated body weight and water intake in Group B. In diabetic liver samples, glucose and glycogen signals were more intense than in healthy livers, while lipid signals showed the opposite effect. Glucose and glycogen signals were less intense in the diabetic liver treated with PBM, while a strong acetate signal was intensified. In conclusion, glucose and glycogen signals were attenuated by PBM, and acetate signals were intensified in diabetic livers."

However, the association between intrapancreatic fat deposition and coronary artery disease has not been well studied. In this study, we investigated the associations between intrapancreatic fat deposition alone or in combination with triglyceride glucose index (TYG) and the risk of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in a general population. A total of 9479 participants who underwent computed tomography (CT) scans for lung cancer screening from 2018-2020 were included in this study. The TYG index was calculated via the following equation: Ln[fasting glucose (mg\/dL)\u00d7fasting TG (mg\/dL)\/2]. Pancreatic CT attenuation was used as a marker of intrapancreatic fat deposition. CAC was evaluated on noncardiogram-gated chest CT. CAC was detected in 2447 of 9479 participants. The prevalence of CAC was significantly lower in subjects with high pancreatic CT attenuation (37.8% in the first quartile (Q1) vs 17.8% in the fourth quartile (Q4), p < 0.001). Pancreatic CT attenuation was associated with the occurrence of CAC (odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-0.97, Q4 vs Q1). The area under the curve of the combination of pancreatic CT attenuation and the TYG index was significantly greater than that of TYG and pancreatic CT attenuation alone in identifying CACs (0.646 vs 0.596 and 0.612, p < 0.001). Intrapancreatic fat deposition was associated with CAC, and the combination of pancreatic CT attenuation and the TYG index performed better than TYG or pancreatic CT attenuation alone in identifying CACs."

This study intends to enhance decision making for patients undergoing TSA and inform perioperative risk by identifying patient demographics, comorbidities, and procedural features linked to these outcomes. Patients who had a primary anatomic or reverse TSA were identified using data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2013 to 2023 using the current procedural terminology code 23472. After categorization by 30-day unplanned readmission and reoperation, perioperative variables were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum and chi-square tests, followed by multivariable logistic regression. The study identified 45,893 patients who underwent a primary TSA between 2013 to 2023 with 1,259 (2.74%) readmissions and 599 (1.31%) reoperations. Readmission was associated with older age, longer operative time, longer hospital stay, inpatient status, American Society of Anesthesiology classification of 4, White or Black race, dependent functional status, smoking, congestive heart failure, steroid use, bleeding disorders, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and anemia. Reoperation was associated with male sex, higher body mass index, longer operative time, longer hospital stay, inpatient status, dependent functional status, smoking, and anemia. This study identified potential patient variables that can increase the risk of unplanned readmission and\/or reoperation after a primary TSA. Understanding the factors that can influence these adverse events can play an important role in clinical decision making and help identify patients who may require additional postoperative monitoring."

        "Abstract":"Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and CV mortality. Despite current guidelines suggesting an RHR threshold of 80 bpm for heightened risk and potential therapeutic intervention, evidence supporting this cutoff remains inconclusive. To assess the relationship between RHR and CV risk in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and identify an RHR threshold above which CV risk significantly increases. A post hoc analysis was conducted using data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD-BP) trial, which included 4733 participants with DM. Baseline RHR were used to stratify patients into RHR categories. Cox proportional hazards models, including restricted cubic splines and segmented regression, were used to evaluate the relationship between RHR and a composite CV endpoint (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or all-cause death), as well as secondary endpoints (CV death, myocardial infarction, and stroke). Higher RHR was associated with increased CV risk, with a nonlinear relationship observed. Segmented regression identified an RHR threshold of 77 (7.4) bpm, above which the risk of CV events increased significantly. Stroke risk was most strongly associated with elevated RHR, while myocardial infarction exhibited a linear relationship with RHR. Our findings suggest that an RHR threshold of approximately 77 bpm may better define increased CV risk in patients with DM compared to the previously proposed 80 bpm cut-off. These results may inform clinical decision-making regarding RHR-lowering interventions in this population."

Data for 217 157 stroke survivors and 312 138 matched controls were analyzed. The relative risk of DM was assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Compared with the controls, stroke survivors had a 2.7-fold higher risk of newly diagnosed DM in the first year and a 15% increased risk thereafter. Severe disability was associated with an elevated DM risk in the first year, but the risk was not significant when a one-year lag period was applied. Ischemic stroke survivors showed significantly higher DM risk than controls, but no significant difference was observed for hemorrhagic stroke survivors. These findings suggest that the type and severity of stroke play crucial roles in the development of DM. Close monitoring and early screening for DM in stroke survivors, particularly those with severe disability or ischemic stroke, could help improve long-term outcomes."

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to modulate erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, but their association remains unclear. This cohort study investigated whether SGLT2i use, compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), is associated with a lower incidence of IDA in T2DM. We analysed data from the IQVIA\u2122 Disease Analyzer, a German electronic medical records database (ICD-10) from office-based practices. Patients with T2DM (\u226518\u2009years) who initiated SGLT2i or DPP-4i therapy alongside metformin between 2012 and 2022 were included. Those with prior anaemia diagnoses were excluded. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed based on age, sex, baseline HbA1c, duration of metformin use, and anaemia-related comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare IDA incidence between cohorts over a 5-year follow-up. In total 28\u2009441 propensity score matched patients per cohort were analysed. The cumulative 5-year incidence of IDA was significantly lower in the SGLT2i (6.9%) versus DPP-4i cohort (11.3%) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). SGLT2i use was associated with a decreased risk of IDA (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.58-0.78). Subgroup analyses confirmed this association in males and elder patients (>60\u2009years), while the protective effect was limited to metformin use under 3\u2009years. SGLT2i therapy was associated with a lower incidence of IDA in T2DM patients compared to DPP-4i therapy. These findings suggest a potential hematologic benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors, warranting further investigation in randomised controlled trials."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and microvascular function. The association between the rs3025039 polymorphism in the VEGF gene and susceptibility to diabetic neuropathy remains controversial. Therefore, the meta-analysis searched databases for relevant articles published from the database establishment to March 1, 2023. Case-control studies examining VEGF gene polymorphisms in relation to diabetic neuropathy susceptibility, providing genotype\/allele frequency data, and involving human subjects were included. Studies with incomplete data, non-human subjects research, or duplicate publications were excluded. RevMan 5.4 and StataMP 17 were used for the meta-analysis, and TSA 0.9.5.10 Beta was used for trial sequential analysis. The pooled analysis of CC vs. CT+TT genotypes, CC vs. CT genotypes, and C vs. T alleles showed an odds ratio >1 and p <0.05 based on the seven identified original studies. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis supported the credibility of the meta-analysis' results.

Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPRs), age-standardized death rates (ASDRs), age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates (ASDARs) and risk factor burdens for total CKD and four etiology-specific types were analyzed. Temporal trends were assessed using the estimated annual percentage change. In 2021, CKD remained a significant global burden, with 673 million prevalent cases and 1.5 million deaths, primarily due to metabolic risk factors. The fastest growth in the ASPR and ASIR occurred in the middle-SDI regions, whereas the highest ASDR and ASDAR were observed in low-SDI regions. From 1990 to 2021, global ASIR increased for CKD caused by all four specific etiologies. The ASDR and ASDAR increased for CKD due to type 2 diabetes, glomerulonephritis, and hypertension, whereas there was a decline in CKD due to type 1 diabetes. Between 1990 and 2021, CKD-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths increased substantially, with type 2 diabetes and hypertension accounting for half of the etiology-specific DALYs in 2021.

This study aimed to (1) determine the prevalence of DM and HT among individuals affected by COVID-19 pandemic in Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh, and (2) explore associations with sociodemographic and biological factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh between April and August 2021. Data was collected from 390 COVID-19-positive patients using a structured questionnaire and physical measurements, focusing on sociodemographic and biological factors associated with DM and HT. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors. Among participants, 12.05% had DM, 15.89% had HT, and 7.95% had both. Older age (\u2009>\u200950 years) was significantly associated with higher prevalence of both conditions (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u2009\u202f0.001).

        "Abstract":"<b>Purpose:<\/b> Chronic inflammation plays a key role in diabetic nephropathy (DN), yet the impact of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) on disease progression remains poorly understood. This study explored the relationship between TLS maturity and renal outcomes in patients with DN. <b>Methods:<\/b> This study included 117 biopsy-confirmed DN patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Patients were grouped based on TLS maturity, as determined by immunohistochemical staining. Clinical, laboratory, and pathological data were gathered, and Cox regression models were applied to assess renal outcome risk factors. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare renal survival among groups. A web-based model integrating TLS maturity, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and renal pathology classification was developed. <b>Results:<\/b> Mature TLSs were associated with worse renal prognosis, with greater disease progression in the TLS+ group (75.4% vs. 53.3%, <i>p<\/i> = 0.006). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified TLS maturity (HR = 1.819, 95% CI: 1.144-2.893, <i>p<\/i> = 0.011), DN glomerular classification (HR = 1.511, 95% CI: 1.057-2.160, <i>p<\/i> = 0.024), and UACR (HR = 1.121, 95% CI: 1.038-1.210, <i>p<\/i> = 0.004) as independent risk factors.

        "Abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide, is characterized by early neuronal damage in the retina, termed diabetic neuropathy in the retina (DNR). This condition is marked by neuronal apoptosis and glial activation. M\u00fcller glia are retinal cells highly susceptible to diabetic metabolic stress that may undergo ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. However, the role of ferroptosis in DNR pathogenesis remains undefined. In this study, we investigated M\u00fcller cell injury under high-glucose and palmitic acid (HGP) conditions. The retinal tissues were obtained from normal rabbits and alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. HGP exposure significantly reduced M\u00fcller cell viability, induced cell cycle arrest, and elevated proinflammatory cytokines. Ultrastructural analysis revealed mitochondrial damage, accompanied by decreased glutathione (GSH) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA), ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+<\/sup>), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) identified <i>SQSTM1<\/i> as a ferroptosis-related differentially expressed gene, which was significantly upregulated in HGP-treated cells. In vivo, DNR rabbits exhibited oxidative stress, iron dysregulation, and elevated SQSTM1 expression that colocalized with GFAP<sup>+<\/sup> M\u00fcller cells. Single-cell RNA-Seq of human proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) retinas confirmed elevated SQSTM1 expression in M\u00fcller cells compared to healthy control (HC) retinas. Mechanistically, <i>SQSTM1<\/i> knockdown attenuated ferroptosis, oxidative stress, and HGP-induced injury, while its overexpression exacerbated ferroptosis via ACSL4 upregulation. Overall, our findings suggest that SQSTM1 may serve as a critical mediator linking M\u00fcller cell dysfunction and ferroptosis in DNR pathogenesis, offering a novel potential therapeutic target."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly type 2 diabetes (T2DM), remains a significant global health concern, driven largely by oxidative stress-induced damage. Marine terpenoids, bioactive compounds extracted from diverse marine organisms such as algae, sponges, and corals, present promising antioxidant and antidiabetic potential. This review systematically evaluates the chemical diversity, biological sources, and mechanisms of action of marine terpenoids in mitigating diabetes-associated oxidative stress. Marine terpenoids exhibit potent antioxidant capabilities via radical scavenging, modulation of cellular antioxidant defenses, regulation of redox-sensitive pathways such as Nrf2\/ARE and NF-\u03baB, metal chelation, and pro-oxidant enzyme inhibition. Preclinical studies underscore their efficacy in reducing hyperglycemia, enhancing insulin sensitivity, preserving pancreatic \u03b2-cell function, and protecting against diabetic complications, including nephropathy and cardiovascular diseases. Despite the promising preliminary results, further studies addressing bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, long-term safety, and sustainability are imperative to establish marine terpenoids as viable therapeutic options for diabetes management."

This study evaluated adherence to initial laser treatment referral\u00a0and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the time of referral, before and after the installation of a regional ophthalmic laser in northwest Tanzania (TZ). Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at a single tertiary care institution in northwest TZ. The study included adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) who were diagnosed with\u00a0VTDR\u00a0by ophthalmologists at Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza, TZ, and referred for initial laser treatment between March 1, 2017, and May 1,\u00a02019.

This narrative review aims to synthesize existing literature on multimorbidity in Saudi Arabia by examining its prevalence, identifying gender-based differences, and highlighting the most commonly associated chronic diseases. A structured search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and institutional databases, including Scopus and Web of Science, for English-language studies on multimorbidity in Saudi Arabia published between 2015 and 2025. Boolean operators were applied, and reference lists were screened to ensure comprehensive coverage while minimizing duplication. A total of 17 studies were included, and data were extracted on study design, population, sample size, multimorbidity prevalence, and gender-specific findings. These were analyzed thematically to identify patterns, disparities in gender, and disease clusters. Multimorbidity prevalence in Saudi Arabia ranged from 7.1% to 77.6%, with notably higher rates among women, especially in older age groups. Among the five studies that reported disease-specific patterns, diabetes mellitus was the most frequently cited chronic condition, ranking first in three studies. Other frequently reported conditions included hypertension and dyslipidemia, though their ranking varied across studies. This review highlights the evolving landscape of multimorbidity in Saudi Arabia. Findings call for gender-sensitive, integrated care models that address the clustering of chronic conditions. To address persistent gaps, future research should prioritize mental health integration, early-onset multimorbidity, and ensuring better representation of rural populations. Policymakers should invest in national screening programs, strengthen data systems, and embed equity into care delivery in line with Vision 2030 reforms."

Modulating this pathway may offer therapeutic benefits for managing T2DM. Chicoric acid (CA), a polyphenolic compound with reported anti-diabetic properties, has shown potential in metabolic regulation; however, its precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of palmitate and CA on the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from newly diagnosed T2DM patients and healthy controls. A total of 40 participants, including 20 newly diagnosed T2DM patients and 20 age-matched healthy individuals (40-60 years), were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and treated with palmitate and CA. The expression of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Protein levels of Smad2\/3 and phosphorylated Smad2\/3 (p-Smad2\/3) were assessed via western blot analysis. Palmitate stimulation significantly upregulated TGF-\u03b21 gene expression and increased p-Smad2\/3 protein levels in PBMCs. However, CA treatment effectively attenuated these palmitate-induced elevations in TGF-\u03b21 expression and p-Smad2\/3 protein levels. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between TGF-\u03b21 expression and p-Smad2\/3 protein levels. These findings suggest that CA may act as an inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway, potentially contributing to T2DM management by downregulating TGF-\u03b21\/Smad signaling.

While children generally experience milder acute COVID-19 symptoms, those with pre-existing endocrine conditions may face heightened risks due to the interplay between viral infection and endocrine homeostasis. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the relationship between endocrine disorders and COVID-19 severity in children, focusing on disease outcomes, metabolic control, and management challenges during the pandemic. Following the\u00a0Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Ten studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected after screening 638 records. Data were extracted on study characteristics, patient demographics, endocrine disorders, COVID-19 severity outcomes, and key findings. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool. A narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes. The review revealed significant pandemic-related disruptions in pediatric endocrine health, including increased central precocious puberty cases and elevated BMI z-scores in children with obesity. Diabetes outcomes were mixed: type 1 diabetes patients had better mortality prognoses than type 2 diabetes patients, but diabetic ketoacidosis rates surged. Thyroid dysfunction and stable medication adherence in congenital adrenal hyperplasia were also noted. Risk of bias varied, with three studies rated low, five rated moderate, and two\u00a0rated as high risk of bias. COVID-19 exacerbated endocrine disorders in children through direct viral effects and indirect lifestyle and healthcare disruptions. The findings underscore the need for adaptive care strategies, including telehealth and mental health support, to mitigate long-term impacts.

This review synthesizes evidence from longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials, highlighting the contrasting evidence to explain the complex association between systemic inflammation and neurodegeneration. These important mechanisms are disruption of the blood-brain barrier, microglial activation, cytokine-related neurotoxicity (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha), lysosomal maladaptation, and metabolic imbalance (e.g., insulin resistance, hyperglycemia). Disease-specific correlations present study outcomes that are paradoxical, including that RA has genetic protection against PD but an increased risk of AD, whereas obesity and T2D associations are the same across studies, persistent associations of these terms with worsened cognitive decline. The risk of dementia is worsened by autoimmune diseases, such as SLE and FM, involving neuroinflammation caused by autoantibodies and central sensitization in the latter, respectively. The new markers, such as\u00a0glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (neuroinflammation) and neurofilament light (NfL) (axonal injury), have prospects in early detection, but there is a need for validation in future studies. Therapeutic approaches emphasize the need for immunomodulation (e.g., disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs {DMARDs} in RA), glycemic control in T2DM, and lifestyle interventions, with a lack of targeting the non-amyloid pathways. New studies should emphasize longitudinal studies, multiome-based methods, and clinical trials in an attempt to create precision treatment. Considering the inflammatory risk stratification in the prevention of neurodegeneration, this review sheds light on the possibility of early preventative action that may offset the progressive cognitive decline in especially vulnerable groups."

Their clinical presentation varies widely among individuals and is primarily linked to the biological effects of excessive catecholamine secretion. We report an unusual case of pheochromocytoma presenting as epigastric heaviness. A 65-year-old male with a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, treated with metformin, and well-controlled hypertension managed with amlodipine, presented with a complaint of persistent epigastric heaviness in the absence of associated symptoms. Abdominal CT imaging revealed a large, locally infiltrative right adrenal mass measuring 92 x 82 x 80 mm. As part of the etiological work-up, serum potassium and urinary cortisol levels were within normal limits. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was established based on significantly elevated urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines, exceeding the normal values by 55-fold and 23-fold, respectively. The evaluation for multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes was negative. Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I-MIBG) scintigraphy confirmed the presence of a hyperfixating adrenal mass, consistent with pheochromocytoma. Following adequate preoperative pharmacologic preparation, the patient underwent a right adrenalectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. Pheochromocytomas are most often benign but may be associated with severe cardiovascular complications due to catecholamine excess. Their clinical diagnosis remains challenging due to the lack of specific signs and symptoms. The diagnosis relies on biochemical assays of catecholamine metabolites, supported by functional and anatomical imaging techniques. Surgical excision, preceded by meticulous pharmacologic preparation, remains the cornerstone of treatment. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent potentially life-threatening complications and ensure favorable outcomes."

A total of 132 adult patients who were diagnosed with T2DM and received dulaglutide (1.5 mg\/week) between\u00a0January 1, 2019, and December 1, 2021, were included. Changes in body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were assessed at baseline, six months, and 12 months. Safety outcomes, including side effects like hypoglycemic events, were recorded. Paired t-tests and descriptive statistics were performed using\u00a0IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) for Windows. Results A significant reduction in BMI was observed at six months (mean decrease from 36.96\u00b16.51 to 36.23\u00b16.78 kg\/m\u00b2, p=0.023), while changes at 12 months were not statistically significant (p=0.178). HbA1c levels decreased significantly over 12 months (from 9.69\u00b11.78% to 8.31\u00b11.62%, p=0.001), (statistical significance was defined as a p<0.05). A total of 24.2% of the patients had hypoglycemia, predominantly among insulin users; adverse effects were reported by 10.6% of patients, such as constipation, nausea, and diarrhea. Conclusion Dulaglutide demonstrated efficacy in weight reduction and significant long-term improvement in glycemic control among Saudi Arabian patients with T2DM. It was well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse effects. These findings support the role of dulaglutide as a therapeutic option for weight and glucose management in diabetic populations."

        "Abstract":"Anastomotic leakage is one of the most severe complications after esophageal cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative inflammatory status on anastomotic leakage after esophageal cancer surgery and to construct a model for predicting anastomotic leakage after esophageal cancer surgery. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1106 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgical treatment between September 2018 and December 2022. Patients were randomly divided into training and testing sets at a ratio of 7:3. Logistic regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis were performed on the training set. Independent influencing factors selected from the analysis were used for model construction. Internal validation was then performed. A total of 1106 patients with esophageal cancer, with a mean age of 64.05 years, were included in our study. Among them, there were 785 male patients (71.0%) and 321 female patients (29.0%). Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of smoking (OR = 2.121, P = 0.016; 95% CI, 1.151-3.938), history of diabetes mellitus (OR = 5.473, P < 0.001; 95% CI, 2.587-11.382), high NMR (OR = 3.423, P = 0.002; 95% CI, 1.628-7.489), high PLR (OR = 3.675, P < 0.002; 95% CI, 1.642-8.406), and low PLT (OR = 0.986, P = < 0.001; 95% CI, 0.980-0.993) were independent risk factors for anastomotic leakage after esophageal cancer surgery. A forest plot was constructed for the independent risk factors, and the ROC curve analysis results showed that the model had good predictive ability in both the training and testing sets. Additionally, calibration curve and DCA curve analyses showed that the model had good predictive ability and net benefit. This study found that smoking history, diabetes history and preoperative inflammatory status (preoperative high NMR, high PLR, and low PLT) were risk factors for postoperative anastomotic leakage in patients with esophageal cancer. Based on these findings, we constructed a model for predicting anastomotic leakage after esophageal cancer surgery that demonstrated good predictive ability."

        "Abstract":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to impaired chloride transport, thickened mucus, and multiorgan dysfunction. Among its complications, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a major concern, characterized by progressive b-cell dysfunction and insulin deficiency. The advent of CFTR modulators, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor\/ivacaftor, and elexacaftor\/tezacaftor\/ivacaftor (ETI), has revolutionized CF management by improving pulmonary function, nutritional status, and overall survival. However, their effects on glucose metabolism remain under investigation. This systematic review (systematic review registration: PROSPERO 2025 CRD420251021499) analyzes recent evidence on the impact of CFTR modulators on CFRD in children and young adults. Results: Ivacaftor demonstrates potential benefits in glucose regulation, enhancing insulin secretion and glucagon control, particularly in patients with gating mutations. Conversely, lumacaftor\/ivacaftor exhibits inconsistent effects, with some studies indicating glucose tolerance improvements while others report insulin sensitivity decline. ETI therapy shows modest but generally positive effects on glycemic control, with reductions in HbA1c and fasting glucose, though without significant changes in insulin secretion. While CFTR modulators improve systemic health, their role in directly preventing or reversing CFRD remains unclear. Further longitudinal studies are needed to optimize therapeutic strategies and elucidate the long-term metabolic effects of CFTR modulation in CF patients. https:\/\/www.crd.york.ac.uk\/PROSPERO\/, identifier CRD420251021499."

        "Abstract":"In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the changes in the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients after saffron supplementation. A comprehensive and systematic investigation was carried out to identify relevant studies on PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases. The investigation aimed to find studies that tested the efficacy of saffron supplements in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in people with type 2 diabetes. The data were synthesized using Revman 5.4 software to perform a meta-analysis. A total of five relevant articles involving 261 patients were included. The meta-analysis results demonstrated a significant reduction in TNF-\u03b1 levels following saffron supplementation compared to the placebo group. However, no significant changes were observed in the levels of CRP levels (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.52 to 0.05, p = 0.97), IL-10 levels (SMD: 0.31, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.67, p = 0.09), IL-6 levels (SMD: -0.28, 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.24, p = 0.29), MDA levels (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.30, p = 0.95), and TAC levels (SMD: -0.09, 95% CI: -0.42 to 0.24, p = 0.59). The findings of this meta-analysis provide compelling evidence to support the efficacy of saffron supplementation in reducing the effects of TNF-\u03b1 levels in individuals with T2DM. Nevertheless, the present body of research is still limited in its ability to establish the precise impact of saffron supplementation on oxidative stress and other inflammatory factors in T2DM patients."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading cause of severe complications, projected to affect 693 million adults globally by 2045. Addressing obesity, a key factor in T2DM, through exercise can improve metabolic health and reduce inflammation. This study conducts a Bayesian network meta-analysis to evaluate the long-term effects of various combined interventions on inflammatory markers and metabolic health in overweight or obese individuals with T2DM. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from January 2000 to April 2023 that examined the effects of aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), combined aerobic and resistance training (ART), physical-mental training (PMT), whole-body vibration training (WBT), and acupuncture (ACT) on BMI, lipid profiles, fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, HOMA-IR, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently conducted by two researchers, and Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using R software. A total of 128 RCTs were included. ART showed the most significant improvements in BMI, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels. PMT was the most effective in improving lipid profiles (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C) and insulin sensitivity markers (HbA1c, HOMA-IR). The SUCRA rankings indicated ART and PMT as the most beneficial interventions. Meta-regression analysis highlighted that VO<sub>2max<\/sub> improvements were closely associated with reductions in BMI and HbA1c. ART and PMT demonstrated comprehensive benefits across multiple metabolic and inflammatory outcomes. ART effectively reduced BMI, improved glycemic control, and decreased inflammatory markers through mechanisms involving AMPK and mTOR pathways. PMT improved lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity by reducing stress hormone levels and modulating endocrine and nervous system functions. A precise exercise prescription combining ART, PMT, AT, RT, and ACT is recommended to optimize metabolic health in T2DM patients. Future research should focus on individualized intervention strategies to enhance clinical outcomes. PROSPERO, identifier CRD42024539376."

        "Abstract":"This study investigated efficacy of intraoperative ibutilide administration for cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) during catheter ablation and evaluated predictive factors for postoperative AF recurrence. A retrospective analysis was conducted involving 111 patients with persistent AF who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation. Patients who failed to restore sinus rhythm after ablation received intravenous ibutilide (1-2\u2005mg). Patients achieving sinus rhythm post-ibutilide administration were categorized as responders, while non-responders underwent electrical cardioversion. Clinical data were collected, and logistic regression was utilized to identify factors associated with ibutilide response and postoperative AF recurrence. Sinus rhythm was restored by ibutilide in 73 patients (65.7%). Non-response to ibutilide was independently associated with longer AF duration (OR\u2009=\u20091.82), diabetes ellitus (OR\u2009=\u20092.27), coronary artery disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.56), increased ST2 (OR\u2009=\u20091.08), larger left atrial diameter (LAD) (OR\u2009=\u20091.25), elevated NT-proBNP (OR\u2009=\u20091.01), and higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores (OR\u2009=\u20091.96; all <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05). AF recurrence within 3 months post-ablation was independently predicted by intraoperative ibutilide non-response (OR\u2009=\u20095.317), older age (OR\u2009=\u20091.213), diabetes mellitus (OR\u2009=\u20090.14), increased LAD (OR\u2009=\u20091.211), elevated ST2 (OR\u2009=\u20091.139), elevated hs-CRP (OR\u2009=\u20091.276), and higher CHA<sub>2<\/sub>DS<sub>2<\/sub>-VASc scores (OR\u2009=\u20092.736; all <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05).

Nevertheless, the role of AIP and DELC in the characterization and prediction of CHD remains underexplored. This study enrolled a total of 1,378 patients suspected to be indicative of CHD, all of whom were admitted to Chengde Central Hospital between September 2021 and August 2024. Based on coronary angiography (CAG), the cohort was stratified into two groups: the CHD group (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u20091,071) and the non-CHD group (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u2009307). Multivariate logistic analysis was used to analyze the interplay of AIP, DELC, and CHD. The predictive value of AIP and DELC for CHD was evaluated by nomogram, calibration curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The results showed that AIP and DELC were positively correlated with CHD. Age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AIP, creatinine (CR), and DELC were independent risk factors for CHD. AIP was correlated with the Gensini score, indicating that as AIP levels rise, the severity of CHD intensifies. A progressive increase in DELC positivity was observed with higher Gensini scores. The diagnostic model for CHD was constructed based on the above risk factors. The area under the curve (AUC) for the integrated application of AIP and DELC was 0.702, highlighting the model's considerable diagnostic efficacy in the identification of CHD. AIP and DELC were independent risk factors for CHD. The combination of the two factors exhibited great predictive value for the diagnosis of CHD."

The RECAM study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chiglitazar add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this randomised, double-blind, phase III trial (NCT04807348), 533 patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by metformin were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive chiglitazar 32\u2009mg (n\u2009=\u2009178), chiglitazar 48\u2009mg (n\u2009=\u2009177), or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009178) for 24\u2009weeks, in addition to metformin. The primary endpoint was the change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 24. At week 24, the least squares mean changes in HbA1c were -0.91% (95% CI: -1.03% to -0.79%) in the chiglitazar 32\u2009mg group, -1.14% (95% CI: -1.26% to -1.02%) in the chiglitazar 48\u2009mg group, and -0.49% (95% CI: -0.62% to -0.36%) in the placebo group. Both chiglitazar 32\u2009mg and 48\u2009mg significantly reduced HbA1c compared to placebo (both p\u2009<\u20090.001), with the reduction being greater in the 48\u2009mg group than in the 32\u2009mg group (p\u2009=\u20090.008). Chiglitazar significantly improved fasting plasma glucose and 2-h postprandial glucose while reducing triglyceride and free fatty acid levels and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The incidence of adverse events was comparable across groups, with a slight increase in weight gain and mild oedema observed in the chiglitazar groups. Chiglitazar combined with metformin significantly improves glycaemic control and lipid metabolism in Chinese patients with T2DM who are inadequately managed with metformin and have a favourable safety profile.

Young adults living with Type 2 diabetes are at a higher risk of diabetes-related complications, hospitalisation and reduced quality of life. While self-management is key in diabetes care, its effectiveness in young adults with Type 2 diabetes remains unclear. This review assessed self-management interventions' impact on health outcomes in young adults (18-45\u2009years) with Type 2 diabetes. Five electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2024. Trials evaluating self-management interventions versus usual care in young adults were included. Outcomes of interest were clinical, self-care behaviour and psychological health. Meta-analysis used a random effects model; study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) and the JBI checklist for quasi-experimental studies. The review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024522979). Ten studies were included, nine in the meta-analysis, which reported no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in HbA1c, body mass index, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, depression or self-efficacy outcomes. Nevertheless, these findings are imprecise due to few studies, missing data and small sample sizes. Commonly used behaviour change techniques were goals and planning, shaping knowledge and feedback\/monitoring. Existing self-management interventions did not improve clinical and psychological outcomes among young adults (18-45\u2009years) living with Type 2 diabetes. More effective strategies are needed for this priority population."

The heterogeneity of current methods and difficult inter-assay comparability of results poses challenges to both clinical interpretation as well as research integrity. We conducted a method validation study comparing the measurement of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), islet antigen 2 (IA-2A), and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A) on three commercially available platforms (EUROLabWorkstation analyzer, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); iFlash 1800 (chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA); Maglumi 800 (CLIA)). Compared to the results from EUROLabWorkstation analyzer that was routinely used in our laboratory, the Maglumi demonstrated an acceptable agreement and deviation for GADA (75.4-35.8\u202f%) and IA-2A (71.7-50.3\u202f%). The iFlash displayed less favorable results with agreement and deviation for GADA (51.5-108.8\u202f%) and IA-2A (68-32.5\u202f%). While the iFlash showed excellent agreement for ZnT8A, the Maglumi produced almost exclusively negative results below a 200\u202fU\/mL threshold which results in severe underestimation of results on the Maglumi. Overall, no consistent agreement was observed across all three parameters among the CLIA devices tested. Our study reveals significant and clinically relevant discrepancies in the detection of GADA and IA-2A when comparing CLIA devices to the ELISA method routinely used in our laboratory. For individual antibodies up to 65\u202f% of patients who tested positive using ELISA showed negative or borderline results on at least one CLIA device. These deviations are unpredictable and cannot be detected through standard calibration and internal control procedures."

In this paper, we describe the training and technical assistance provided and evaluate implementation and sustainability. CHC teams attended in-person learning sessions and regular web-based check-ins, implemented a 6-month GV program, and completed surveys and reports. We analyzed changes in staff knowledge and attitudes from pre- to post-training. We measured adoption, engagement, fidelity, tailoring, staff satisfaction, and barriers and facilitators to implementation. Using a mixed-methods multi-site case study approach, we identified factors related to sustainability. All 7 CHC teams successfully implemented GVs for 6\u00a0months; 4 continued GVs after the study period. Teams adapted the GV model to their local contexts while retaining the core elements of individual medical care, group education, goal setting, and social support. Staff enjoyed GVs and thought they benefited patients. Key factors that differed between sites that continued GVs and sites that did not were team cohesiveness, experience, and stability; success in operationalizing GV model components; ongoing adaptation and improvement; and ability to demonstrate benefits and address concerns regarding the organizational impact of GVs. The Diabetes MESSAGES learning collaborative offered a flexible GV model, a roadmap for implementation, expert coaching, and co-learning with other CHCs. CHCs succeeded in implementing diabetes GVs despite barriers. Lessons learned may be useful for others hoping to establish and maintain their own GV programs."

        "Abstract":"Dulaglutide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is approved for improving glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular risks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This research investigates the effect of dulaglutide on gastric emptying and its impact on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered molecules utilizing a combination of population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approaches. In clinical studies, the gastric emptying delay (GED) was evaluated in healthy participants and patients with T2DM at various dose levels of dulaglutide. A PopPK model estimated the exposure-dependent delay in gastric emptying, which was then input into the orally administered small molecule PBPK models. These PBPK models, informed by internal clinical studies and publicly available data, quantified the effect of dulaglutide-induced GED on the area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C<sub>max<\/sub>), and time to maximum concentration (t<sub>max<\/sub>) of the co-administered drugs. The modeling approach was verified for reproducing observed GED-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) at low doses of dulaglutide and to predict DDIs at a 4.5\u2009mg dulaglutide dose. The clinical studies demonstrated that the 1.5\u2009mg dulaglutide dose has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of small molecules, and the modeling led to a similar conclusion at 4.5\u2009mg dulaglutide. This work demonstrates that modeling approaches can be used to predict potential GLP-1-mediated DDIs related to gastric emptying delay, increasing the efficiency of the clinical pharmacology programs."

        "Abstract":"Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalance that has traditionally posed significant challenges in the management of heart failure (HF). This review explores the complex interplay between hyperkalemia and the use of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT), such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (sMRAs), including spironolactone and eplerenone, which are currently recommended in guidelines for improving outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). While these therapies reduce mortality and hospitalizations in HFrEF, their benefit in patients with heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\u2009\u2265\u200940% remains less conclusive. Nevertheless, their use in clinical practice is often limited by the risk of hyperkalemia, potentially leading to dose reduction or discontinuation of life-saving treatments. The prevalence of hyperkalemia in HF patients is notably higher compared to the general population, particularly in those with comorbid chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus, further complicating management. This review emphasizes the importance of regular potassium monitoring, the potential benefits of combining therapies such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors with RAASi to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia, and the emergence of the newer non-steroidal MRA (nsMRA), finerenone, which may have a lower risk of hyperkalemia. Additionally, potassium binders such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) are highlighted for their role in managing and preventing hyperkalemia, allowing patients to continue optimal RAASi and MRA therapy without interruption. By synthesizing current evidence on the incidence, risks, and management strategies of hyperkalemia in HF, this review aims to provide a comprehensive guide for clinicians to optimize patient outcomes while mitigating the risks associated with hyperkalemia."

Placement of a central venous catheter can delay time to osmotherapy and may negatively impact patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the safety of 23.4% sodium chloride administered through a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter. This was a retrospective observational cohort study conducted at a large academic health system. Patients were admitted to one 719-bed academic medical center and a level I trauma center or one 247-bed academic community hospital. Study participants were 18\u00a0years or older, admitted between March 29, 2015, and October 21, 2023, and received 23.4% sodium chloride through a peripheral IV. Patients who died within 24\u00a0h of 23.4% sodium chloride administration or were discharged less than 24\u00a0h after administration were excluded. All study participants received at least one 30\u00a0mL bolus of 23.4% sodium chloride administered through a peripheral IV catheter. The primary outcome, defined as extravasation of peripherally administered 23.4% sodium chloride, was assessed using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale and occurred in 56 of 863 administrations (6.4%). Secondary outcomes included incidence of tissue necrosis, interventions used to treat extravasations, and attributable risk factors for extravasation. There were no cases of tissue necrosis, no surgical interventions performed, and one case of medical intervention using hyaluronidase. Patients with a history of diabetes had a 2.39\u00a0times higher risk of experiencing a 23.4% sodium chloride extravasation event (95% CI 1.41-4.05, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Peripheral administration of 23.4% sodium chloride was associated with a low rate of extravasation and no significant injury in patients who did experience a possible or probable extravasation event.

This study investigated the impact of body mass index (BMI)-related genetic variants on GWG and GDM risk among Taiwanese women. A case-control study of 3875 pregnant women included 3162 with GDM based on oral glucose tolerance tests and 2483 with GWG data. A genome-wide association study of 71,848 women identified BMI related genetic variants, and a polygenic risk score for BMI (PRS_BMI) was calculated. PRS_BMI was positively associated with GWG (R\u00b2 = 0.010, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The odds ratio (ORs) for high GWG and GDM per standard deviation increase in PRS_BMI were 2.28 (95% CI\u2009=\u20092.03-2.55, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 1.34 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.24-1.45, P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. Stratified analyses indicated stronger associations in women with BMI\u2009<\u200925\u2009kg\/m\u00b2, while weaker associations were observed in those with BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u2009kg\/m\u00b2. These findings suggest PRS_BMI could be used to identify women at higher risk for excessive GWG and GDM, aiding in early monitoring and targeted risk-reduction strategies."

        "Abstract":"Bryonia laciniosa is traditionally used in Ayurveda to treat various disorders, including diabetes and inflammation. It is also used as an aphrodisiac agent. Its potential to treat diabetes mellitus-associated reproductive dysfunction is still unexplored. This study aims to investigate the protective effect of Bryonia laciniosa seeds in streptozotocin-induced diabetic male rats. Diabetic male rats were treated with 2 different doses of ethanolic extract of B. laciniosa for 28 days. GC-MS analysis was conducted to identify the phytochemical constituents present in the extract. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to evaluate the interaction and binding efficiency of the identified phytocompounds with target proteins, thereby assessing the therapeutic potential of the plant. Biochemical analysis revealed that B. laciniosa significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose and lipid profile. It has also ameliorated the sperm parameters and decreased antioxidant activity in the testis. Serum testosterone level significantly increases in diabetic rats after treatment with the extract. It also prevents histological damage in the organs of diabetic rats. TNF-A, COX-2 and IL-6 level significantly decreases after treatment. GC-MS analysis of the plant revealed that there are 47 compounds in the extract and their molecular dynamics analysis revealed that its phytochemicals have a substantial affinity to treat diabetes-associated reproductive dysfunction in males. Bryonia laciniosa demonstrates significant potential in enhancing reproductive function, while concurrently ameliorating fasting blood glucose levels and modulating lipid profiles in diabetic rats."

This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of early use of subcutaneous insulin glargine U100 (iGlar U100) or U300 (iGlar U300) alongside intravenous insulin in managing DKA in adults with T1DM. The study included 90 patients with T1DM diagnosed with DKA randomized into 3 groups. In addition to the standard intravenous regular insulin infusion, the iGlar U100 and the iGlar U300 groups received 0.3 units\/kg of subcutaneous iGlar U100 and iGlar U300 respectively while the control group received only the standard intravenous insulin infusion. The mean time to DKA resolution was significantly shorter in the iGlar U100 group (6.78 \u00b1 2.13 hours) and iGlar U300 group (6.33 \u00b1 1.94 hours) compared to the control group (11.12 \u00b1 6.15 hours; p<0.001 for both comparisons). Both the iGlar U100 and iGlar U300 groups required significantly lower total insulin dose compared to the control group. No significant differences were observed between the iGlar U100 and iGlar U300 groups concerning the duration to DKA resolution (p=0.693) or the total insulin dose administered (p=0.908). The incidence rates of hypoglycaemia, hypokalemia, rebound hyperglycaemia and rebound DKA were similar across the three study groups (p=0.871, 0.657, 0.718 and 1 respectively). Early combination iGlar U100 or iGlar U300 with intravenous insulin infusion was associated with faster resolution of DKA and reduced total insulin requirements without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Both iGlar U100 and U300 displayed similar safety and efficacy."

        "Title":"Early-onset diabetes with low utilization of lipid as an energy source carrying a rare missense mutation in the CEL gene.",
        "Abstract":"Carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) is a major component of pancreatic juice and is responsible for the duodenal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of diabetes mellitus characterized by early onset and dominant inheritance of beta-cell dysfunction. CEL gene mutations cause the type of MODY denoted as MODY8. Herein, we describe a Japanese patient who harbored a heterozygous A689P mutation in the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs)-containing exon 11 of the CEL gene. The patient was not obese and his diabetes was characterized by onset in late adolescence, impaired insulin secretion and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The C-terminal region of CEL has been postulated to be critical for its secretion and activity. Therefore, the A689P mutation may cause pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and eventually contribute to MASLD, which is associated with reduced lipid catabolism. MODY8 is also considered to be a protein-misfolding disease because a heterozygous single nucleotide deletion causes the production of mutant CEL protein leading to diabetes and exocrine dysfunction. In the present case, MASLD and diabetes characterized by impaired insulin secretion were observed. The CEL A689P missense mutation will expand the known genotype-phenotype correlation in diabetes if it can be demonstrated that the variant is pathogenic. The CEL gene encodes the digestive enzyme carboxyl ester lipase, also known as bile salt-stimulated\/dependent lipase. CEL is expressed in pancreatic acinar tissue but not in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. MODY caused by mutations in the CEL gene (MODY8) is characterized by dominantly inherited diabetes mellitus manifesting in early adulthood. A classical feature of MODY8 is pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, often with onset in childhood. Known pathogenic mutations in the CEL gene affect the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region in exon 11. Our case suggests that some missense mutations of the CEL VNTR could have a phenotypic implication by being associated with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reduced utilization of lipid as an energy source which leads to MASLD."

        "Abstract":"Hyperglycemia can shorten red blood cell (RBC) lifespan, leading to incorrectly measured glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. Correcting for the impact ofthe RBC lifespan on HbA1c is a critical issue in clinical practice. Before establishing a generally accepted correction formula to account for the impact of RBC lifespan on HbA1c, it is necessary to investigate the duration necessary to emake the hyperglycemia-induced RBC lifespan shortening reverse to normal. This longitudinal clinical trial examined the RBC lifespan in 31 hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by measuring the concentration of exhaled endogenous carbon monoxide. The 31 non-smoking patients with type 2 diabetes were all admitted due to blood glucose imbalance, and their RBC lifespan was tested at admission, discharge (after ~2 weeks of intensive glycemic control), and 3 months after discharge. During the period from admission to three months after discharge, RBC lifespan significantly increased in the patients as they underwent drug treatment to control blood glucose (BG) (P < 0.05) effectively. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (2hPG) decreased significantly. This study found that (i) a shortened RBC lifespan caused by hyperglycemia is reversible, and (ii) the time required for this reversal is three months of effective drug treatment to control BG."

To date, although the roots of ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) have revealed nephroprotective and antidiabetic activities, including Arginyl-Fructosyl Glucose (AFG), a non-saponin compound of red ginseng, the mechanism of action involved in diabetic nephropathy specifically remains unclear. This study was designed to assess the ameliorative effects of AFG In vitro and In vivo on kidney injury in T2DM mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD)\u00a0+\u00a0sucrose\/Streptozotocin (STZ). The results showed that AFG significantly attenuated fasting blood glucose (FBG), body weight variation, and food and water consumption. Furthermore, the histopathological and immunofluorescence analyses combined with mRNA and protein expressions in HEK293 cells and T2DM mice revealed the ability of AFG to improve glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammation. AFG also alleviated apoptosis, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance by upregulating PI3K\/AKT, p38 MAPK\/ERK and insulin-like signaling pathways in cross-talk with the TGF-\u03b2\/Smad signaling pathway. Overall, AFG could improve kidney and pancreatic injury on HFD\u00a0+\u00a0sucrose\/STZ-induced T2DM through the downregulation of TGF-\u03b2, involved in kidney fibrosis, and Smads, act as his downstream mediator. It is thus suggesting that AFG could become a novel therapeutic drug for T2DM and its complications."

        "Abstract":"Cognitive impairment is the common complication of diabetes, while its etiology remains not fully understood. Gardenia jasminoides is used in traditional Chinese medicine for clearing heat and detoxification. Its effective components Geniposide and Genipin have been found to show protective effect on diabetic cognitive impairment in our previous study. Whereas the effect and mechanism of Shanzhiside methyl ester (SME), another major component of Gardenia jasminoides, on cognitive impairment have been scarcely reported. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of SME on cognitive impairment symptom in diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced by HFD\/STZ. HG\/PA induced BV2 cells were used as the in vitro model. Network pharmacology and bioinformatic analyses showed that HSP90AA1 might be the target of SME. As a result, SME attenuated cognitive impairment-related behavior in Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. The treatment with SME inhibited inflammation, glycolysis via HSP90AA1\/HIF1A\/STAT1 signaling both in vivo and in vitro. SME regulated the transcriptions of inflammation, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial stress related genes. The transfection with HSP90AA1 SiRNA or overexpression plasmid, the treatment with HIF1A inhibitor PX478, STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine suggested that HSP90AA1\/HIF1A\/STAT1 signaling was required for the anti-inflammatory and anti-glycolytic effects of SME. The treatment with glycolysis agonist oligomycin, hexokinase inhibitor 2-DG, PKM2 activator TEPP46, PKM2 inhibitor Shikonin demonstrated that glycolysis was critical for the anti-inflammatory effect of SME. It was found that SME might combine with HSP90AA1. SME attenuated cognitive impairment symptom of diabetic mice possibly via HSP90AA1\/HIF1A\/STAT1 mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-glycolytic effects."

While most frequently arising from secondary infection of inadequately managed post-traumatic hematomas. Despite rhinoseptoplasty being a clean-contaminated procedure, postoperative incidence remains below 1\u00a0%, attributable to the region's robust vascularization. A 40-year-old female with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presented four weeks post-rhinoseptoplasty with bilateral nasal obstruction and septal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography CT scan imaging confirmed the diagnosis of nasal septal abscess, necessitating urgent hospitalization in our otolaryngology department. The advent of broad-spectrum antibiotics and improved healthcare access has significantly reduced the incidence of this condition. However, potential complications remain severe, including intracranial extension (meningitis, cerebral abscess), septicemia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Immunocompromised patients demonstrate particular vulnerability to disease progression. This pathology carries significant functional and life-threatening implications, underscoring the critical importance of prompt diagnosis and immediate therapeutic intervention."

PRS (423 T2DM-related single nucleotide polymorphisms) and coffee consumption (via food frequency questionnaire) were categorized into tertiles (low, medium, and high) based on the population distribution. Multinomial logistic regression and dose-response analyses were performed to evaluate the cross-sectional associations between PRS and coffee consumption with prediabetes and T2DM. Fully adjusted analyses indicated that medium and high coffee consumption were associated with lower odds of prediabetes (odds ratios [ORs]: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.92 and 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.96) and T2DM (ORs: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.91 and 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.91). U-shaped associations were observed for both prediabetes and T2DM, with the overlapping range of 2.9-6.9 cups\/day statistically associated with lower odds (OR\u2009<\u20091) for both conditions.

This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models that preoperatively predict insufficient clinical improvement one year after TKA using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) subscales and total scores, and to assess the important predictive variables. A retrospective analysis was performed on consecutive primary TKA patients from 2004 to 2022 at a single tertiary hospital was conducted. Insufficient clinical improvement was defined as not achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for each WOMAC subscale and total. Candidate preoperative variables included demographics, comorbidities, knee range of motion, radiologic variables, and WOMAC scores. A variety of ML models were evaluated using performance metrics for calibration and discrimination, as well as decision curve analysis and Shapley additive explanations. Among the 3,810 TKAs included, the ExtraTrees model performed best for WOMAC pain, stiffness, function, and total scores, achieving AUCs of 0.92, 0.90, 0.87, and 0.89; recall rates of 0.79, 0.86, 0.70, and 0.83; and Brier scores of 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, and 0.06, respectively, along with demonstrating good calibration curves and net clinical benefit. Shapley additive explanations identified better preoperative WOMAC scores, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, older age, malignancy, and coronary artery disease as important predictors of insufficient clinical improvement. The ML models demonstrated good performance in preoperatively predicting insufficient clinical improvement at 1 year after TKA based on WOMAC. These models have the potential to enhance SDM and perioperative patient management by preoperatively identifying approximately 70% to over 80% of patients likely to experience insufficient clinical improvement, with a specificity of about 80%, and by providing explanations regarding associated factors."

However, so far, there is no study in the literature that has explored genetic factors through which T2D drive the development and progression of KC. Therefore, this study attempted to explore T2D- and KC-causing shared key genes (sKGs) for revealing shared pathogenesis and therapeutic drugs as their common treatments. The integrated bioinformatics and system biology approaches were utilized in this study. The statistical LIMMA approach was used based web-tool GEO2R to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through transcriptomics analysis. Then upregulated and downregulated DEGs for T2D and KC were combined to obtained shared DEGs (sDEGs) between T2D and KC. The STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of sDEGs. Then Cytohubba plugin-in Cytoscape were used in the PPI network to disclose the sKGs based on different topological measures. The RegNetwork database was used in NetworkAnalyst to analyze co-regulatory networks of sKGs with transcription factors (TFs) and micro-RNAs to identify key TFs and miRNAs as the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of sKGs, respectively. AutoDock Vina is a tool used for molecular docking. ADME\/T properties were 24 assessed using pkCSM and SwissADME. At first, 74 shared DEGs (sDEGs) were identified that can distinguish both KC and T2D patients from control samples. Through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, top-ranked 6 sDEGs (CD74, TFRC, CREB1, MCL1, SCARB1 and JUN) were detected as the sKGs that drive both KC and T2D development and progression. The most common sKG 'CD74' is associated with key pathways, such as NF-\u03baB signaling transduction, apoptotic processes, B cell proliferation. Differential expression patterns of sKGs validated by independent datasets of NCBI database for T2D and TCGA and GTEx databases for KC. Furthermore, sKGs were found to be significant at several CpG sites in DNA methylation studies. Regulatory network analysis identified three TFs proteins (SMAD5, ATF1 and NR2F1) and two miRNAs (hsa-mir-1-3p and hsa-mir-34a-5p) as the regulators of sKGs. The enrichment analysis of sKGs with KEGG-pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) terms revealed some crucial shared pathogenetic mechanisms (sPM) between two diseases. Finally, sKGs-guided four potential therapeutic drug molecules (Imatinib, Pazopanib hydrochloride, Sorafenib and Glibenclamide) were recommended as the common therapies for KC with T2D. The results of this study may be useful resources for the diagnosis and therapy of KC with the co-existence of T2D."

This study enrolled a total of 106 T2DM patients, 106 T2DM patients with DN, and 70 healthy individuals. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-21-5p, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-21-5p in DN. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to examine the association between miR-21-5p levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary protein excretion rate (UAER) and other clinicopathological parameters of glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, the effects of miR-21-5p on the function and inflammation of human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) were analyzed. Serum miR-21-5p is upregulated in DN and it can effectively distinguish DN patients from T2DM patients. Pearson correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between miR-21-5p and eGFR and a positive correlation with UAER. Finally, the knockdown of miR-21-5p reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by high glucose (HG) and the proliferation of HMCs. Serum miR-21-5p is upregulated in DN and it might be a diagnostic marker for DN. Furthermore, miR-21-5p may be involved in the occurrence and progression of DN by regulating cell proliferation and inflammatory responses and is expected to become a potential therapeutic target for DN."

We assessed the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on in-hospital, 30-day, and 30-day to 1-year mortality in a Northern Chinese real-world cohort. An electronic health record-based cohort was constructed from the Tianjin Health and Medical Data Platform from January 2013 to December 2022. Statistical analyses, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariable regression analysis, and propensity score matching, were undertaken to evaluate the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates. A total of 23,486 patients with both AMI and DM were included. Patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 5053) were younger (64.2 vs 67.2 years) and had a higher frequency of dyslipidemia (26.4% vs 18.5%) and history of percutaneous coronary intervention (17.1% vs 15.3%) than those who did not receive them. After multivariable adjustment, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors showed a lower mortality rate during hospitalization (odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.58), at 30 days (hazard ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.36-0.53), and at 30 days to 1 year (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.73-1.00). These findings were further supported by propensity score matching and subgroup analyses, which consistently confirmed the reduction in mortality across all three time points. In a real-world electronic health record-based cohort in China, this study confirmed a mortality benefit with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with combined DM and AMI. Further studies are needed to validate these benefits across broader populations."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains a prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. A growing body of evidence highlights the central role of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-mTOR-autophagy axis in the pathogenesis of DKD. Chronic hyperglycemia significantly induces TXNIP expression, triggering oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in renal cells. TXNIP directly promotes activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), which consequently impairs autophagic flux, leading to accumulation of damaged organelles and proteins, cellular hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Restoration of autophagy via inhibition of TXNIP or mTOR signaling pathways alleviates these pathological changes in various DKD models. Specifically, genetic or pharmacological suppression of TXNIP attenuates oxidative injury, reduces inflammasome activation, and restores autophagic activity. Similarly, mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin have demonstrated substantial renoprotective effects through reactivation of autophagy and reduction of renal fibrosis. Furthermore, combined targeting of TXNIP and mTOR presents a promising therapeutic strategy that may synergistically restore autophagic homeostasis with reduced side effects. This review synthesizes recent mechanistic insights into the interplay between TXNIP, mTOR signaling, and autophagy dysregulation in DKD and discusses potential therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, understanding and therapeutically targeting the TXNIP-mTOR-autophagy axis could offer new opportunities for effective clinical management of diabetic kidney disease."

        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with various maternal and fetal complications, including long-term cardiovascular risks for affected women. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between GDM and arterial stiffness during pregnancy and 2 months postpartum. A\u00a0cross-sectional study was conducted with 100 pregnant women of 28-40\u00a0weeks of gestation and divided into 2 groups. The groups were divided based on oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) results: 50\u00a0women with GDM and 50\u00a0controls with normal oGTT. All participants in the GDM group had a\u00a0form of GDM that was successfully managed by diet only. Arterial stiffness was assessed using a\u00a0non-invasive oscillometric device, the Arteriograph\u00ae (TensioMed<sup>TM<\/sup> Kft, Budapest, Hungary), by measuring the right brachial artery. The results showed that during pregnancy the pulse wave velocity (PWV) was unexpectedly significantly lower in the GDM group compared to controls (8.10\u202fm\/s vs. 8.65\u202fm\/s, P\u202fT<\u20090.05). Central and brachial augmentation index (AIx) values showed no significant differences between the groups. No differences in PWV or AIx were observed between GDM and control groups 2 months postpartum; however, within the GDM group, central (0.50\u202f% vs. 11.45\u202f%) and brachial (-73.35\u202f% vs. -51.75\u202f%) AIx significantly increased after delivery, indicating postpartum vascular effects of GDM.These findings suggest that even diet-managed forms of GDM can induce vascular changes postpartum, underscoring the importance of early detection and management. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these changes and their possible long-term implications for cardiovascular health in post-GDM women."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may adversely affect the course and treatment outcomes of Crohn's disease (CD). However, data remain inconsistent. To evaluate the impact of T2DM on clinical outcomes and advanced therapy use in patients with CD using real-world electronic health record data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Global Collaborative Network. Adult patients with CD were stratified by the presence of T2DM. Propensity score matching was used to balance demographic and clinical characteristics. Primary outcomes included corticosteroid use, abdominal surgery, drug-related adverse events, and the initiation of advanced therapies. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of neoplasms and mental disorders. Time-to-event outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios. After matching, 7,182 patients were included in each cohort. Corticosteroid use was higher in diabetic patients (61.6% vs 55.2%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), as were abdominal surgery (32.8% vs 31.1%; p\u2009=\u20090.010) and drug-related adverse events (4.3% vs 2.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Anti-TNF (10.4% vs 12.2%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and IL-23 inhibitors (4.6% vs 5.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.018) use was lower in diabetic patients. Use of vedolizumab (2.4% vs 2.6%; p\u2009=\u20090.401) and JAK inhibitors (0.6% in both; p\u2009=\u20090.955) was similar. Neoplasm rates were comparable (3.5% vs 3.2%; p\u2009=\u20090.386), while mental disorders were more common in the diabetic cohort (51.5% vs 41.2%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients with CD and coexisting T2DM experience a more severe disease course yet appear to be undertreated with advanced therapies.

Recently, the GLP-1 RA semaglutide was reported to reduce cardiovascular events in ASCVD patients with overweight or obesity even in the absence of diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, this was included in the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines for secondary prevention. We aimed to assess the number of inpatients with ASCVD who could qualify for therapy with GLP-1\u00a0RA. Using nationwide data from the Research Data Centre of the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, a random 10% sample of all adult inpatients in 2022 was analyzed. The proportions of ASCVD, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were examined. The 10% sample included 1,446,420 patients with a mean age of 63.16 years, 52.50% were female. ASCVD was present in 229,619 inpatients (15.87%), including those with coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease or stroke. Among ASCVD patients, 79,516 individuals (34.63% of ASCVD patients) also suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus and 15,624 individuals were diagnosed with obesity. Approximately half of those (N\u2009=\u20097,256) had ASCVD and obesity without diabetes mellitus (3.16% of ASCVD patients). Overall, 37.79% of ASCVD patients also suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity. In this data sampling of German inpatients, more than one-third of ASCVD patients may qualify for GLP-1 RA therapy due to concomitant diabetes mellitus or obesity. That corresponds to about 6% of inpatients in Germany."

Patients with type 2 diabetes-related CKD who initiated finerenone therapy between March 2023 and February 2024 at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were retrospectively included. All patients were followed up at least once during the 12-week observation period. Key parameters, including urinary albumin\/creatinine ratio (UACR), 24-h urine protein, serum creatinine, and potassium (K<sup>+<\/sup>) levels, were recorded. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated based on serum creatinine using the Collaborative Epidemiological Formula for Chronic Kidney Disease. A total of 105 patients (mean age, 59.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.3\u00a0years; 81 males and 24 females) were included, with 82.9% diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy.

This study aimed to investigate the association of accelerometer-measured PAV, defined as daily fluctuations in physical activity levels, with mortality and chronic disease incidence. Two cohorts were analyzed: the UK Biobank (2013-2015) with follow-up through November 2022, and NHANES (2003-2006) with follow-up through December 2019. PAV, calculated as the coefficient of variation of hourly physical activity, represents high variability (peaks and troughs) versus low variability (stability). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality, as well as incidence of CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adjusting for total activity volume (i.e., average acceleration) and important confounders. In the UK Biobank, individuals in the highest PAV quartile had lower risks of all-cause mortality (28%, 21%-35%), CVD mortality (42%, 24%-56%), and incidences of CVD (19%, 12%-25%), T2DM (37%, 26%-46%), and COPD (45%, 35%-54%). In NHANES, the highest PAV quartile was associated with 23% (7%-36%) and 50% (18%-69%) lower risks of all-cause and CVD mortality. PAV was inversely associated with risks of mortality and chronic disease, independent of total volume of physical activity. The health implications of PAV warrant further investigation."

To study the most used anticoagulant treatment in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) with and without cerebrovascular disease in Mexico. CARMEN-AF is a national, multicentric observational registry that includes 1423 patients with AF. Patients were recruited regardless of the anticoagulant therapy. Demographics, clinical variables, comorbidities and antithrombotic treatment were compared among patients with and without a history of cerebrovascular disease. Of the 238 patients with a previous cerebrovascular disease (average age 69\u00b113 years; 114 women [48.5%]), 99% had a previous ischemic stroke. In this subgroup, the type of AF was permanent 43.4%, persistent 20%, and paroxysmal AF was 36.6%. Principal comorbidities were hypertension 77.9%, diabetes mellitus 29.8%, and heart failure 20%. Nearly 12.4% of patients with a history of ischemic cerebrovascular disease did not receive anticoagulant (AC) treatment.

We analyzed data from 3944 CKD participants in the NHANES survey (1999-2020). Binary and ordered logistic regression analyses assessed the TyG index's impact on hypertension categories (uncontrolled, resistant, and refractory hypertension) and severity. Higher TyG index quartiles were significantly associated with higher odds of hypertension categories after adjustments for covariates. Specifically, the odds ratios (ORs) for the highest quartile were 1.68 (1.27-2.22) for uncontrolled hypertension, 2.24 (1.41-3.58) for resistant hypertension, and 2.17 (1.18-3.99) for refractory hypertension compared to the lowest quartile. The continuous TyG index showed similar trends, with ORs of 1.28 (1.10-1.49), 1.54 (1.23-1.94), and 1.40 (0.97-2.01), respectively. Higher TyG index levels were also linked to greater hypertension severity. The ORs (Q2, 3, 4 vs. Q1) were 1.29 (1.01-1.65), 1.37 (1.10-1.72), and 1.80 (1.40-2.32), respectively. Each one-unit increase in the TyG index raised the OR for hypertension severity to 1.34 (1.17-1.53). This study demonstrated that an elevated TyG index is significantly associated with higher odds of uncontrolled, resistant, and refractory hypertension, as well as greater severity of hypertension. The findings underscored the utility of the TyG index as a valuable biomarker for evaluating resistant hypertension risk and hypertension severity among patients with CKD in community settings."

        "Abstract":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The prevalence of CVD is significantly increased in CKD patients, and the frequency of CVD increases as the CKD stage worsens. Although atherosclerosis is more common in CKD patients, the lipid profile may change as the CKD stage changes. Many mechanisms cause this. Also, mortality is more common in patients with advanced CKD. In this study, we aim to emphasize the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and dyslipidemia in patients with CKD at different stages and the effect of these variable conditions on patient mortality. Patients who applied to the internal medicine outpatient clinic and were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease were examined. Mortality and complications were followed up for one year. A total of 1323 patients with a diagnosis of CKD between stages 3a-5 were included in the study. The relationships between kidney functions and lipid profiles, biochemical values, and prognosis of the patients were evaluated. Non-survivors had lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. High-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and albumin values decreased, and CRP increased as the disease stage progressed. More survivors had CKD and hyperlipidemia than non-survivors. It was observed that the stage remained the same in patients with hyperlipidemia at a higher rate. In contrast, the stage worsened or remained at stage 5 more in patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Declining CKD stage and increasing CRP were influential risk factors that affect mortality. It is essential to closely monitor the changes in laboratory parameters at baseline and follow-up in CKD patients to predict or prevent comorbidities, mortality, and deterioration in patients' renal functions."

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a significant contributor, but lots of patients are difficult to distinguish. Distinguishing between ASB and symptomatic UTIs can greatly assist clinicians in rational use of antimicrobials. Patients with T2DM and UTIs caused exclusively by UPEC were recruited from the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University between 2018 and 2023. Demographic and clinical data were systematically collected for these patients through a retrospective electronic chart review, in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We utilized this dataset as training set to develop an ASB predictive model called ASBPredictor. A total of 337 cases were collected, comprising 158 cases (46.9%) of ASB and 179 cases (53.1%) of symptomatic UTIs. Based on the optimal predictive model, ASBPredictor exhibited a remarkable level of precision, achieving an area under the curve score of 0.82. The identification of ASB is influenced by several crucial factors, including urinary bacteria, urinary white blood cell clusters, C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, glucose, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, sodium ions (Na<sup>+<\/sup>), and eosinophils.

While bariatric surgery remains the gold standard for treating severe obesity, its invasive nature has led to the development of minimally invasive alternatives. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a promising, minimally invasive procedure for weight loss, offering significant weight reduction without the need for surgical incisions. This editorial evaluates the efficacy and safety of ESG, highlighting its weight loss outcomes, safety profile, and comparison with other bariatric procedures, including intragastric balloon, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, and robotic sleeve gastrectomy. ESG has shown substantial weight loss with a mean total weight loss ranging from 15.03% to 17.51% at 12 months and sustained weight reduction over 36 months. The safety profile is favorable, with low rates of serious adverse events and minimal complications compared to surgical alternatives. ESG is particularly suited for patients with mild to moderate obesity or those not eligible for surgical options.

A population-based, multicenter prospective study (LATENTTB-NSTM) was implemented since 2013 to assess the prevalence of TBI and to track the development of active disease in rural China. This cohort study provides an opportunity to address these gaps in knowledge. In October 2023, all 21,832 participants from rural China who initially participated in the baseline survey of the LATENTTB-NSTM study were invited to take part in the 10-year follow-up survey. The data on the incident PTB and other health concerns including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancers, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were acquired from medical record or self-reported. The proportion of baseline TBI and newly acquired infection to the incident PTB and the association of baseline TBI status with the incidence of other diseases were analyzed. Overall, 21,211 study participants with a sum of 170,152 person-years were included in final analysis. During the 10-year period, a total of 181 incident PTB patients were identified, including 134 patients developed from TBI defined at baseline and 47 patients developed from newly acquired infection during follow-up. The proportion of newly acquired infection during follow-up was statistically pronounced in incident PTB cases diagnosed in the latter 5 years as compared to in the first 5 years of the follow-up period (38\u00b730% (18\/47) vs. 21\u00b764% (29\/134), p = 0\u00b7031).

In addition, baseline TBI status was found to be significantly associated with increased risk of incident T2DM, cancers and chronic bronchitis with adjusted hazard ratio of 1\u00b722 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1\u00b704-1\u00b742), 1\u00b781 (95% CI: 1\u00b720-2\u00b772), and 2\u00b794 (95% CI: 1\u00b706-8\u00b715), respectively. The risk of incident T2DM slightly increased along with the increasing intensity of the immune response in TBI testing at baseline. As compared to recent infection, TBI remains the dominating contributor of incident PTB in rural China. Alongside efforts to systematically manage infectious cases and close contacts, preventive treatment targeting individuals under high risk of developing active diseases from TBI is crucial for achieving rapid declining of PTB incidence. Moreover, the possible influence of TBI on the other health conditions further underscores the importance of TBI management from a new perspective.

The present study aimed to assess awareness of oral health implications among T2DM patients in Ajman, UAE, and to identify predictors of good awareness. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 306 self-reported T2DM patients at a tertiary hospital. A validated, structured questionnaire assessed awareness across 12 oral health indicators. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used, with logistic regression to identify predictors of good awareness (score \u22656\/12). While 83.7% of participants acknowledged a general oral health impact of diabetes, awareness of specific complications was low, particularly regarding caries risk (24%) and effects on glycemic control (23%). Predictors of good awareness included higher education (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1-4.6), T2DM duration \u226510 years (AOR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.6-7.0), recent dental visits (AOR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.2-7.0), and use of internet resources (AOR: 7.87, 95% CI: 1.3-46.4). Receiving education from healthcare providers was not significantly associated with improved awareness.

Diabetic patients are more susceptible to metabolic syndrome. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the various risk factors associated with diabetes that contribute to the development of MetS. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MetS and assess the risk factors and individual components of MetS in diabetic patients across both sexes and various age groups. Material and methods This cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in diabetic adults who visited the general medicine outpatient department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Mangalagiri. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. The collected data were analyzed according to the guidelines of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Heart Association\/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA\/NHLBI) Joint Scientific Statement (2009) for MetS diagnosis. Results A total of 388 patients with diabetes mellitus were included in this study.

A strong correlation between female sex and central obesity (n=168, 90.8%; p<0.001) and lower HDL-C levels (n=146, 78.9%; p<0.001) was present. A significant correlation was found between comorbidities, including hypertension (n=164, 86.3%, p=0.016), dyslipidemia (n=92, 88.5%, p=0.031), and the prevalence of MetS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that waist circumference (odds ratio {OR}: 1.1; p=0.016), systolic blood pressure (OR: 1.09; p=0.016), fasting blood glucose (OR: 1.02; p=0.044), and triglycerides (OR: 1.02; p=0.025) were independent predictors of MetS. Conclusion This study shows a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among diabetic patients, with females showing higher prevalence of MetS and its components, particularly central obesity and low HDL-C levels. The study also found statistically significant associations between MetS and glycemic parameters such as postprandial blood sugar\u00a0and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These findings emphasize the need for targeted screening and early intervention, particularly among female and younger diabetic patients. Public health initiatives focusing on lifestyle modifications and glycemic control are essential to mitigate MetS complications. Due to sociocultural diversities, region-specific studies are needed to develop localized guidelines for the effective management and prevention of metabolic syndrome."

        "Title":"Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",
        "Abstract":"People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can have both physical and mental problems that tend to lower their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While T2DM is a serious issue for health worldwide, not much is known about its influence on the quality of life (QoL) for patients in Pakistan. The main goal of this study is to measure the QoL in patients with T2DM in Pakistan and to see how a range of factors can impact their HRQoL. The research involved completing a cross-sectional study of 385 patients with T2DM from outpatient and diabetes care centers in Pakistan. Information was gathered using both the Diabetes Quality of Life Questionnaire (QoL-Q Diabetes)\u00a0and the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Both tests, i.e., Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk, were applied to check if the data followed the usual pattern. It also used descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, independent samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA, chi-square tests, and linear regression methods. We used IBM SPSS Statistics version 26, along with a p-value lower than 0.05, when carrying out statistical analysis. The interview process took place from November 2024 to April 2025. \u00a0The analysis pointed out that scores for HRQoL varied significantly depending on the period of the disease, the care offered, and whether there were complications. On the Pearson correlation, a small and noticeable relationship (r = 0.074, p < 0.001) was found between the QoL-Q Diabetes and SF-36 scores. Those who lived with diabetes and treated it with insulin for a long time had scores that were somewhat lower for HRQoL. Although several differences between groups were statistically significant, their effect sizes were small, suggesting limited clinical relevance.\u00a0The gaps that were noted in the study were mostly small in real-life situations. People who suffer from additional health problems, such as nephropathy and neuropathy, live with a noticeably lower HRQoL. In conclusion, our research shows that T2DM has a moderate influence on patients' HRQoL in Pakistan. The most important factors influencing this are the type of treatment, the duration of T2DM, and any complications that develop. Although some group differences were statistically significant, the effect sizes were small, indicating minimal clinical impact. Therefore, individualized and comprehensive care remains essential to improve patients' overall QoL meaningfully."

        "Abstract":"Intractable hiccups are a rare but distressing symptom that can significantly impair a patient's quality of life, particularly in those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This case report describes a 59-year-old male patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented to the emergency department with persistent hiccups lasting for five days, coinciding with an exacerbation of his diabetes leading to DKA. Despite initial treatments with metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, and baclofen, the hiccups persisted, causing considerable distress. The patient was subsequently treated with inhaled nebulized lidocaine at a dosage of 150 mg daily for two days. Remarkably, within 24 hours, the patient experienced a significant reduction in hiccup frequency, and by the end of the treatment course, the hiccups had completely resolved. This case highlights the potential efficacy of nebulized lidocaine as an alternative treatment for intractable hiccups associated with DKA, particularly when conventional therapies fail. Given the promising results, further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms and broader applicability of this treatment approach in similar patient populations."

        "Abstract":"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a leading gastrointestinal cause of hospitalization worldwide. While gallstones, alcohol use, and hypertriglyceridemia account for most cases, pancreatic malignancy remains an underdiagnosed but critical etiology requiring prompt identification due to its significant prognostic implications. To systematically evaluate the clinical characteristics of tumor-associated AP and identify risk factors influencing early diagnosis. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 167 patients with pancreatic cancer-associated AP (2014-2023), stratified by diagnostic timing: Early-diagnosis (<i>n<\/i> = 75, identified during initial AP admission) <i>vs<\/i> delayed-diagnosis (<i>n<\/i> = 92, requiring \u2265 2 admissions). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictors of early cancer detection. The early-diagnosis group demonstrated distinct clinical and biochemical signatures, with independent predictors including: Diabetes history [odds ratio (OR) = 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-3.34], concurrent AP etiologies (OR = 4.77, 95%CI: 1.84-7.81), elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.03-1.84), hyperbilirubinemia (direct: OR = 2.36, 95%CI: 1.35-3.48; indirect: OR = 2.67, 95%CI: 1.38-4.62), and serum glucose (OR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.08-2.55). Key high-risk indicators for occult pancreatic malignancy in tumor- associated AP patients include: Advanced age, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, hyperbilirubinemia, and concurrent with conventional AP etiologies. These findings advocate for enhanced surveillance protocols incorporating serial tumor markers and multimodal imaging to earlier cancer detection."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) impairs wound healing due to hyperglycemia-induced immune dysfunction. Dendritic cells (DCs) in the skin are crucial for wound healing but are adversely affected by hyperglycemic microenvironment. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-exos), especially adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs) with higher accessibility, have shown potential for immune regulation. However, their yield and efficacy can be limited. This study aims to explore the effects of TNF-\u03b1-preconditioned ADSCs-exos (T-exos) on restoring DC function and accelerating wound healing in T2DM. T-exos were isolated from ADSCs pretreated with TNF-\u03b1. The regulatory effects of T-exos on DC immune responses under high glucose conditions were assessed. Subsequently, the roles of DCs treated with T-exos in diabetic wound healing were evaluated. Finally, the mechanism underlying T-exos-mediated regulation of DCs was investigated in detail. Under high glucose conditions, T-exos suppressed DC activation, as evidenced by reduced CD80\/CD86 expression and NLRP3 inflammasome activity. In vivo studies showed that T-exos promoted wound closure in T2DM mice, enhancing collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and fibroblast proliferation. Mechanistically, TNF-\u03b1 enriched miR-146a-5p in exosomes, which targeted TXNIP to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in DCs. Knockdown of miR-146a-5p abolished these effects in vitro and the therapeutic effect of T-exos on wound healing in vivo. This study elucidates a previously unrecognized role for T-exos in effectively regulating DC activation through the miR-146a-5p\/TXINP\/NLRP3 axis, which in turn modulates the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. By synergistically dampening inflammation and enhancing tissue repair, T-exos exhibit significant potential for clinical application in T2DM wounds."

        "Abstract":"Tuberculosis(TB) is still among the leading causes of death from a single infectious pathogen worldwide. TB treatment is long, requires multiple drug combinations, and therefore adherence monitoring. TB hair drug levels have been suggested as a technique of treatment adherence monitoring; however, the drug levels might be affected by physiological factors, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking. This can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TB drugs. To assess the effect of physiological factors, smoking, and alcohol on isoniazid hair drug levels during TB treatment. Patients were assessed for diabetes Mellitus, smoking, alcohol consumption, age, weight, and gender. Hair drug levels were measured by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry(LC-MS). We screened a total of 102 TB patients and enrolled 56 participants out of which 50 completed the study. We excluded 15 participants who were not sampled exactly at 1-month appointment dates and of the remaining 35; the mean hair drug level was 0.0706ng\/mg, 95% CI: 0.0303-0.1109. Tests of interaction across the different subgroups yielded no statistically significant interaction coefficients(IC) except for age and gender (IC=-0.36.95%, CI: -0.55-0.17, P=0.001).

A total of 132 T2DM patients were divided into LSG group (n=66) and LRYGB group (n=66). The operation time, time of postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery, postoperative hospital stay, and incidence rate of complications were compared. The glucolipid metabolism indexes [fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), fasting C-peptide (FCP), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)], body weight and nutritional status [body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hb)], insulin function and insulin resistance were recorded. Short-from 36 (SF-36) questionnaire was also conducted. LSG group had shorter operation time, less blood loss, and quicker postoperative recovery than LRYGB group. Both groups showed significant improvements in BMI, FBG, FINS, FCP, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR. After 12 months, LRYGB group had significantly higher scores in physical function, general health, vitality, role emotional, and mental health in SF-36 questionnaire compared to LSG group. Compared with LRYGB group, LSG group had significantly decreased operation time, reduced intraoperative blood loss, and shortened postoperative off-bed time. BMI, FBG, FINS, FCP, HbA1c and HOMA-IR all markedly declined in the two groups after operation. At 12 months after operation, the scores of physical function, general health, vitality, role emotional and mental health in the SF-36 questionnaire were all remarkably higher in LRYGB group than those in LSG group. LSG can be used to treat obesity complicated with T2DM, which is characterized by simple operation, small trauma and quick postoperative recovery."

We aimed to determine the prevalence of endometrial cancer and its associated factors among non-pregnant women with abnormal uterine bleeding. After obtaining ethical approval from the Research Ethical Committee of the Makerere college of Health Sciences, we retrospectively retrieved and analyzed the paraffin embedded tissue blocks of 159 patients who were non-pregnant women and they were presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding from January 2012 to December 2018. The clinical and pathological information was obtained from the patient's files. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 23.0. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied in determining the risk factors of endometrial cancer. A two-tailed p -value <0.05 was considered significant. The overall mean age of the patients was 36.4 \u00b1 13.7 years and the vast majority 71.1% (113\/159) of the patients were premenopausal women. The prevalence of endometrial cancer was 11.9% (19\/159). Being postmenopausal (AOR = 7.7, 95% CI = 2.155 - 27.666, p = 0.003), having menarche below 12 years (AOR = 4.5, 95% CI = 0.217-0.390, p<0.001), being obese (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 0.305-0.822, p = 0.01), and being nulliparous (AOR = 5.4, 95% CI = 0.292-0.957, p = 0.009) were significantly associated with endometrial cancer. However, use of contraceptive pills, family history of reproductive cancers, having hypertension and\/or diabetes mellitus all were not associated with endometrial cancer. Our study has further proven that, there is a significant proportion of non-pregnant women with AUB who have endometrial cancer. Using the clinical parameters such as age of the patient and age at menarche, nulliparity and obesity, it may help in increasing the index of clinical suspicion in daily clinical practice to diagnosing endometrial cancer among women with AUB at early stage. This will help in improving the prognosis of the patients."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease condition and one of public health importance in Africa and indeed globally. Its potential complications can be mitigated by tight control of blood glucose, achievable by both short and long term glucose monitoring. The values of these measures are expected to both be within target, but for some reasons, sometimes these values become discordant. This study is aimed at determining the pattern of short and long term glycemic control prevalent among Type 2 diabetic patients in the study environment and the extent of the discordance between them. A cross-sectional study carried out at University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu. Research participants comprised consenting adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin were used to assess short and long term glycemic control respectively. The study included 148 participants (60 males and 88 females). Glycated haemoglobin (HbAlc) correlated significantly with Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) (P < 0.00001). Prevalence of optimal long and short term glycemic control was 42.6% and 35.8% respectively. The proportion of individuals with concordance between FPG and HbA1c was 116 (78.4%) while 32 (21.6%) had discordant values. Glycemic control, both long and short terms, was sub-optimal among participants. Discordance observed between HbA1c and FPG creates some dilemma in clinical decision making, and calls for guidelines and uniformity in the clinical management of these conditions."

This study investigates the association between CMI and carotid atherosclerosis (CAS), as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and explores whether insulin resistance (IR) mediates this relationship. This cross-sectional study enrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients hospitalized at Cangzhou People's Hospital between September 2024 and March 2025. Logistic regression models, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and subgroup analysis were used to examine the CMI-CAS relationship. The predictive ability of CMI was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and its incremental value beyond traditional risk factors was evaluated by integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Mediation analysis assessed the role of IR. After adjustment, higher CMI was significantly associated with increased odds of CAS (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.21-1.81, <i>P<\/i> < 0.001). RCS analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between CMI and CAS. ROC analysis indicated moderate predictive power (AUC = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.61-0.68). Including CMI improved prediction with an IDI of 0.04 (<i>P<\/i> < 0.001) and an NRI of 0.26 (<i>P<\/i> < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant interaction with T2DM duration (<i>P<\/i> = 0.013). Mediation analysis showed that metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) partially mediated the CMI-CAS relationship, explaining 12.92% of the total effect. Elevated CMI is independently associated with higher risk of CAS in T2DM patients, and insulin resistance partially mediates this relationship. CMI may be a valuable marker for early vascular risk stratification in diabetic populations."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 224 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM from January 2021 to July 2024. Based on neonatal birth weight, 112 women were assigned to the macrosomia group, and 112 women with normal birth weight infants were assigned to the normal group. Serum levels of D-D, GSP, and HbA1c were measured and compared between the two groups. Binary regression analysis and ROC curve analysis were performed to assess the relationship between these biomarkers and the risk of macrosomia. The macrosomia group had significantly higher levels of D-D (4.90 vs 2.98 mg\/L), GSP (3.49 vs 3.07\u00a0\u03bcmol\/L), HbA1c (7.49% vs 5.85%), and HOMA-IR (4.35 vs 3.84) compared to the normal group (all p<0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that D-Dimer (OR\u202f=\u202f2.374), Glycated Serum Protein (GSP, OR\u202f=\u202f31.890), and HbA1c (OR\u202f=\u202f2.482) were significantly associated with the occurrence of macrosomia, even after adjusting for confounders including BMI. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the combined detection of D-D, GSP, and HbA1c had an AUC of 0.9241, with a sensitivity of 83.93% and specificity of 86.61%, providing higher diagnostic accuracy than single biomarkers. Serum D-D, GSP, and HbA1c levels are significant factors in predicting macrosomia in GDM pregnancies. The combined use of these markers can improve diagnostic accuracy and serve as a valuable tool for early identification of high-risk pregnancies in clinical practice."

This study evaluated changes in body composition by SGLT-2Is alone or combined with Semaglutide. This retrospective cohort included T2DM-CKD patients treated with SGLT-2Is \u00b1 Semaglutide for \u22656 months. Body composition (fat, muscle, water, bone mineral content [BMC]) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis pre- and post-treatment. Among 73 participants (SGLT-2Is: n = 61; combination: n = 12), both groups showed reductions in total fat mass, total muscle mass, total body water, and BMC. Combination therapy exhibited greater fat mass loss (-0.9 kg [IQR: -3.7,0.4] vs -0.6 kg [-1.7,0.7];\u00a0<i>P<\/i> = 0.011) and muscle mass decline (-1.1 \u00b1 1.2 kg vs -0.4 \u00b1 0.8 kg;\u00a0<i>P<\/i> = 0.015) versus monotherapy.

No differences between to groups in BMC, fat percentage, or fat-to-muscle ratio (<i>P<\/i>>0.05). Within the SGLT-2Is group, higher baseline SMI correlated with greater muscle loss, while higher baseline FMI was associated with attenuated BMC decline. SGLT-2Is with\/without Semaglutide reduced body composition parameters of fat, muscle, water, and BMC in T2DM-CKD. Combination therapy exacerbated absolute muscle loss but increased the muscle mass-to-body weight percentage, without significantly altering fat-to-muscle ratio. Baseline muscle and fat mass may influence treatment-related changes. Long-term studies in high-risk populations are needed."

This study included 615 type 2 diabetes patients, collecting demographic, biochemical, and carotid ultrasound data. Spearman correlation analyzed UHR's relationship with cardiovascular risk factors. Multivariate logistic regression combined with stratified regression modeling assessed UHR's independent link with CAS, while receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated its predictive value. CAS patients showed elevated UHR and cardiovascular risk markers (age, body mass index [BMI], homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], triglycerides, smoking) compared to controls (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05). UHR tertiles demonstrated dose-response associations with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) \u22651.0 mm, plaque formation, and CAS (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05).

The research enrolled 238 patients who underwent total gastrectomy and esophagojejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis for gastric cancer between January 2017 and June 2022 in the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery of the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University and retrospectively collected clinical data of the patients. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors of EJAL and a nomogram based on the results was constructed. The predictive ability of the model was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve. In addition, the clinical benefit was indicated by decision curve analysis (DCA). Ultimately, a Bayesian network model was developed to analyze the interrelationship between the risk factors. Esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage occurred in 13 of 238 patients (5.4%). End-to-side anastomosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), preoperative albumin (ALB) \u2264 33.6 g\/L, drinking history and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) > 1.18 were identified as independent risk factors for EJAL based on multivariable logistic regression. A nomogram containing the aforementioned factors was constructed, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.880. Likewise, the model showed good predictive ability and clinical application in the calibration curve and DCA. Ultimately, the Bayesian network model demonstrates that type of anastomosis (ToA), DM, and ALB were directly associated with EJAL development, while gender, age, drinking history, smoking history, hypertension, and SIRI were conditionally dependent on EJAL given the presence of mediator variables. Surgeons should be alert to the occurrence of EJAL, especially in patients with end-to-side anastomosis, DM, drinking history, preoperative lower ALB, and higher SIRI. Also, males, advanced age, smoking history, and hypertension can affect the development of EJAL."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a major microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, is closely associated with abnormal lipid metabolism, which contributes to secondary renal injury. The JAML\/SIRT1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating renal lipid metabolism during DKD progression. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of Wenyang Jiedu Tongluo Formula (WYJDTLF) on lipid metabolism in DKD, we conducted an animal study using db\/db mice. The mice were treated with WYJDTLF for 4\u00a0weeks, and its efficacy was evaluated through assessments of liver and kidney function, lipid profiles, and renal histopathology. Renal injury was examined using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), and Masson's trichrome staining. Podocyte damage was assessed by quantifying the expression of podocyte marker proteins (Nephrin and NPHS2) using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the expression levels of key proteins in the JAML\/SIRT1 signaling pathway were analyzed via Western blot (WB). The results demonstrated that WYJDTLF significantly improved liver and kidney function, reduced lipid deposition and inflammatory damage, and alleviated renal fibrosis and pathological injury. These effects were mediated through the regulation of the JAML\/SIRT1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, WYJDTLF treatment upregulated the expression of Nephrin and NPHS2, indicating a protective effect on podocyte integrity. Our team has revealed for the first time that the WYJDTLF can improve lipid metabolism abnormalities in db\/db mice and alleviate diabetic kidney disease-induced renal pathological damage by inhibiting the JAML\/SIRT1 signalling pathway. These findings provide a scientific basis for the potential application of WYJDTLF in the treatment of DKD."

After one-year follow-up, patients in the experimental group showed significant improvements in fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin, serum creatinine, urinary microalbumin, NT-proBNP, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter compared to the control group (P<0.05). Empagliflozin also reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, with a non-significant increase in adverse reactions such as urinary tract infections and genital infections. Empagliflozin demonstrates efficacy in improving glycemic control and cardiorenal function in T2DM patients over 65 with CRS. However, the drug's effect on biomarkers of acute myocardial injury and thrombosis requires further investigation. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of CRS and emphasises the need for larger-scale, long-term studies to confirm these findings."

        "Abstract":"Among individuals with diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common microvascular complication. As renal dysfunction progresses in DN patients, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) significantly increases. The current effective treatment of DN and CVD demands identifying and managing their risk factors. Patients diagnosed with DN from October 2022 to October 2023 were selected for cross-sectional study and divided into DN group (n=58) and DN\/CVD group (n=40) based on the presence of CVD. Univariate analysis was conducted using clinical data, and statistically significant independent variables were analysed through multivariate Logistic regression to identify independent factors influencing CVD in DN patients. A regression model was developed to examine the non-linear relationship between C1q, UA, CRP, and the risk of CVD. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to analyse the predictive efficacy of the indicators. When elevated, UA and C1q were independent factors for CVD. A linear relationship existed between UA and C1q and the risk of CVD in DN patients. C1q showed better predictive performance. As UA and C1q levels rise, the risk of CVD in DN patients significantly increases. In DN patients, UA and C1q are associated with CVD development and progression, offering some supportive evaluation value for the patient's condition."

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Viral infections have been proposed as contributing triggers, supported by the disease's seasonal pattern, which typically shows higher incidence in autumn and winter. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdowns created a unique context to examine the incidence and seasonality of T1DM during a period characterized by reduced circulation of common viral infections. To investigate the incidence and seasonality of T1DM before and during COVID-19 pandemic in relation to global viral infection rates. This population-based retrospective study utilized a nationwide computerized database. Extracted data included the number of new T1DM cases over the 8 years preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic, demographic characteristics of affected individuals, and nationwide respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction data from weekly nasal wash sample collections. A total of 2176 patients were diagnosed with new-onset T1DM during the pre-pandemic period, compared to 348 cases during the pandemic. In the same periods, 33727 respiratory virus-positive polymerase chain reaction results from nasal wash samples were recorded pre-pandemic, compared to 2603 during the pandemic. Additionally, 363399 positive COVID-19 cases were reported during the pandemic period. Seasonality analysis revealed a higher rate of new-onset T1DM cases and a weaker seasonal pattern during the pandemic. Trend analysis showed a consistent increase in T1DM incidence prior to COVID-19, with a more variable trend observed during the pandemic. Correlation analysis between T1DM incidence and respiratory viruses demonstrated a weak correlation between T1DM incidence and a few respiratory viruses. The observed increase in new-onset T1DM cases and the disruption of its typical seasonal pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a potential association between respiratory virus exposure and the development of T1DM."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic cystopathy (DCP) is a complication affecting the lives of people with diabetes. However, the pathogenesis of DCP is not well known. To investigate the potential mechanisms by which cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3 like 3 (CREB3 L3) promotes the occurrence and development of DCP. High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in bladder urothelium from patients with DCP and healthy controls. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted to assess the biological functions of DEG. Small interfering RNA technology was performed to silence the CREB3 L3 gene in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments. Morphological changes in bladder urothelium from a DCP rat model were observed. Immunofluorescence and western blotting assay were performed to determine associated protein expression. We identified significant DEGs through high-throughput sequencing. These genes were primarily enriched in inflammatory activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tight junction organization. Upregulated expression of both CREB3 L3 and C-reactive protein (CRP) in bladder urothelium from patients with DCP was accompanied by upregulated EMT markers including N-cadherin and vimentin proteins, but downregulated E-cadherin. Silencing CREB3 L3 attenuated the protein expression of CRP and EMT in SV-HUC-1 urothelial cells under hyperglycemic conditions and in the diabetes mellitus rat model at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. CREB3 L3 knockdown also reversed downregulation of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 1. Hyperglycemia induces the upregulation of CREB3 L3 expression, thereby promoting the EMT and impairing tight junctions in bladder urothelial cells. Targeting CREB3 L3 in bladder urothelial cells is likely to be a key approach in preventing and treating DCP."

        "Abstract":"Cardiovascular disease represents a major complication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with insulin resistance (IR) recognized as a key underlying pathophysiological mechanism. The metabolic score for IR (METS-IR), a simple, non-invasive, and insulin-independent surrogate marker of IR, has been validated for risk stratification and prognostic assessment in conditions such as hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and T2DM. Monitoring fluctuations in METS-IR levels among individuals with T2DM may facilitate early identification of elevated cardiovascular risk and inform timely therapeutic adjustments. To investigate the association between METS-IR and cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM and to evaluate its potential utility as a predictive biomarker. This study represents a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial, ultimately including 10191 patients with T2DM aged 40 years to 79 years, with a follow-up duration of approximately 10 years. Baseline METS-IR was calculated using triglycerides, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose. The predictive value of METS-IR for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), all-cause mortality, congestive heart failure, and major coronary heart disease events, was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, restricted cubic spline analysis, and stratified subgroup analyses. Multivariable adjustments were performed to account for potential confounding factors. The incidence of MACEs increased steadily across higher METS-IR quartiles. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, hazard ratios comparing the highest to the lowest METS-IR quartile were 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.45] for MACEs, 1.55 (95%CI: 1.23-1.96) for cardiovascular death, 1.39 (95%CI: 1.21-1.59) for all-cause mortality, 2.22 (95%CI: 1.74-2.82) for congestive heart failure, and 1.35 (95%CI: 1.17-1.56) for major coronary heart disease. Restricted cubic spline analysis supported a positive, dose-dependent relationship between rising METS-IR levels and cardiovascular risk. Moreover, adding METS-IR to conventional risk prediction models enhanced their performance, as evidenced by improvements in the C-statistic, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement. Subgroup analyses indicated possible interactions between METS-IR, hemoglobin A1c levels, and aspirin therapy. METS-IR shows a strong correlation with cardiovascular risk in individuals with T2DM. Tracking METS-IR levels could enhance risk assessment and the prediction of cardiovascular events."

        "Abstract":"Wolfram syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by early-onset diabetes and progressive neurodegeneration, most notably sensorineural hearing loss and optic atrophy. Because its initial manifestations are usually similar to those of type 1 diabetes, the diagnosis may be delayed until other manifestations appear. Pathogenic variations of the <i>WFS1<\/i> gene can disrupt endoplasmic reticulum function and cellular homeostasis, but the complete mutation spectrum of <i>WFS1<\/i> has not been fully determined. Early identification of monogenic diabetes caused by Wolfram syndrome is of vital importance, as it enables the provision of targeted multidisciplinary care and genetic counseling for affected families. A 2-year-old Han Chinese girl was admitted with a 1-month history of polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia, and was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and impaired insulin secretion. Sensorineural hearing loss was also detected. Whole-exome sequencing identified a previously unreported heterozygous mutation, <i>WFS1 c.986T>C<\/i> (<i>p.Phe329Ser<\/i>), in the patient and her father, confirming the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome. Bioinformatic analysis supported the likely pathogenicity of this mutation<i>. In silico<\/i> pathogenicity predictors (REVEL, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster, and GERP+) supported a deleterious effect on wolframin structure and function. The patient was initially treated with intravenous insulin and fluid resuscitation, then transitioned to a basal-bolus insulin regimen. Glycemic control was subsequently maintained with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and intermittent subcutaneous injections. At the 1- and 6-month follow-ups, blood glucose remained well controlled (hemoglobin A1c: 5.89% and 6.58%, respectively), with no evidence of organ dysfunction or further complications. This case identifies <i>WFS1 c.986T>C (p.Phe329Ser)<\/i> as a novel pathogenic variant causing Wolfram syndrome. It highlights the importance of early genetic testing in pediatric patients with atypical diabetes presentations to enable timely diagnosis, individualized therapy, and comprehensive family support."

To identify the key demographic, clinical, and biochemical factors associated with carotid plaque formation in T2DM patients and evaluate their predictive value. This retrospective study included 266 T2DM patients (control group, <i>n<\/i> = 158; observation group, <i>n<\/i> = 108) recruited between January 2021 and July 2024. Participants underwent carotid ultrasonography to measure intima-media thickness (IMT) and detect carotid plaques. Comprehensive demographic and biochemical data, including age, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum creatinine (Scr), urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and serum uric acid (SUA), were collected. Statistical analyses, including Pearson correlation, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, were performed to identify and evaluate factors associated with carotid plaque formation. Significant differences in age, BMI, HbA1c, FPG, Scr, UACR, and SUA were observed between groups (all <i>P<\/i> < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed IMT was positively associated with age, FPG, HbA1c, Scr, UACR, and SUA, and negatively with HDL-C.

To investigate the genes associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and pyroptosis in type 2 DM (T2DM), and elucidate their mechanisms of action in T2DM. The datasets GSE76894, GSE41762, and GSE86469 were utilized in this study. UPS-related genes (UPSGs) and pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) were obtained from existing literature. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were intersected with UPSGs and PRGs to identify differentially expressed UPSGs and PRGs. Ubiquitin-pyroptosis-related biomarkers were determined using Spearman's correlation, <i>t<\/i>-tests, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Pathway enrichment of biomarkers was assessed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) and Spearman's correlation were used to analyze the relationship between biomarkers and immune cells. A competitive endogenous RNA network was constructed. Subsequently, drugs related to the biomarkers were identified and a gene-drug network was established. In dataset GSE86469, single-cell sequencing was utilized to determine cell types. Finally, the expression levels of biomarkers were validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot analysis. A total of 581 DEGs were identified in GSE76894. Four genes [ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (<i>ABCC8<\/i>), retinol binding protein 4 (<i>RBP4<\/i>), Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (<i>RASGRF1<\/i>), and solute carrier family 34 member 2 (<i>SLC34A2<\/i>)] were identified as ubiquitin-pyroptosis-related biomarkers in T2DM, based on consistent expression trends and significant differences in GSE76894 and GSE41762. These biomarkers were enriched in oxidative phosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, which are relevant to DM. ssGSEA revealed significant differences in the enrichment scores of nine immune cell types between groups.

Psychological constructs such as perceived severity and susceptibility influence health behaviour, yet their role in pediatric diabetes management remains underexplored. To examine psychological predictors of DKA in children with T1DM using the health belief model, and to assess the role of caregiver-perceived understanding in influencing adherence and DKA occurrence. A case-control study was conducted at Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, involving 191 caregivers of children with T1DM (96 cases with a history of DKA and 95 controls without). Validated questionnaires measured perceived severity, susceptibility, understanding, and adherence. Statistical analyses included independent <i>t<\/i>-tests, Pearson and Spearman correlations, and multiple regression. Perceived understanding was the strongest predictor of adherence (\u03b2 = 1.03, <i>P<\/i> < 0.001) and was inversely associated with DKA occurrence (<i>P<\/i> < 0.001). Children without a DKA history had significantly higher levels of perceived understanding and adherence. Perceived severity had a moderate positive association with adherence, while perceived susceptibility showed a weak negative correlation. Caregiver-perceived understanding plays a critical role in adherence and DKA prevention. These findings support expanding the health belief model to include perceived understanding as a distinct construct and highlight the importance of integrating comprehension-focused strategies into pediatric diabetes education."

To investigate the correlation between intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, low-grade inflammatory status, renal function impairment, and disease severity in older patients with DN, in order to provide a basis for the prevention and therapeutic intervention of DN. We enrolled 167 older patients with DN, diagnosed in the Department of Nephrology between June 2020 and June 2023. Eighty-five patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (without DN) were enrolled to serve as the control group. A one-year follow-up observation was conducted. We compared the differences in gut microbiota composition, levels of inflammatory markers, and renal function indicators between the two groups, and the characteristics of gut microbiota and the changing patterns of inflammatory markers across different stages of disease progression. In the DN group, the Chao, Ace, and Shannon indices were significantly lower, while the Simpson index was significantly higher than the control group. The relative abundances of <i>Bacteroides<\/i> and <i>Bifidobacterium<\/i> were significantly lower, whereas the relative abundances of <i>Clostridium, Butyricimonas, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Veillonella<\/i>, and <i>Megamonas<\/i> were significantly higher than those in the control group (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05). Estimated glomerular filtration rate was positively correlated with the Chao, Ace, and Shannon diversity indices of the gut microbiota, as well as with the relative abundances of <i>Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium<\/i>, and <i>Akkermansia<\/i>, and was negatively correlated with the relative abundances of <i>Clostridium, Klebsiella,<\/i> and <i>Enterococcus<\/i> (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that lower Chao, Ace, and Shannon indices and higher Simpson index were associated with an increased risk of developing DN. After one year of follow-up, patients in the progression group exhibited a significantly greater decrease in Chao, Ace, and Shannon indices and a greater increase in Simpson index than the stable group. The reduction in the relative abundances of <i>Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium,<\/i> and <i>Butyricimonas<\/i>, as well as the increase in <i>Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Veillonella,<\/i> and <i>Megamona<\/i>s, were significantly more pronounced in the progression group than in the stable group (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05). Regression analysis indicated that greater declines in Chao, Ace, and Shannon indices and <i>Bacteroides<\/i> relative abundance, along with greater increases in Simpson index and <i>Enterococcus<\/i> relative abundance, were associated with a more rapid decline in renal function. The onset and progression of DN in older patients with diabetes are closely associated with gut microbiota composition. The more severe the dysbiosis, the lower the abundance of beneficial bacteria and the higher the abundance of harmful bacteria, leading to an increased risk of both DN occurrence and disease progression."

To ascertain whether TyG-BMI correlates with cardiovascular outcomes and mortality risk in individuals diagnosed with T2DM. Data were drawn from the ACCORD trial and its subsequent follow-up (ACCORDION), which together included 10190 participants. To evaluate the associations of TyG-BMI with future cardiovascular outcomes and overall mortality risk among T2DM patients, Cox's proportional-hazards model was employed. Non-linear associations and thresholds were investigated by performing restricted cubic spline regression, fitting smooth curves, and conducting piecewise regression. Additionally, we examined whether the above findings were robust through interaction and subgroup analyses. The robustness of results was further verified by a series of sensitivity assessments. Through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve estimation, the incremental predictive power of TyG-BMI beyond conventional risk factors was also evaluated. Applying multivariable Cox regression analysis, we identified a significant correlation of TyG-BMI with both cardiovascular outcomes and overall mortality. Specifically, after adjusting for multiple confounders, the cardiovascular mortality, congestive heart failure (CHF) and overall mortality risks in the highest TyG-BMI quartile were 1.74, 2.65 and 1.42 times greater, respectively, when compared to the lowest quartile. The analysis revealed that TyG-BMI was linked nonlinearly to both types of mortality, while a two-stage linear regression discerned inflection points at 252.77 for cardiovascular mortality and 245.90 for overall mortality. TyG-BMI was found to correlate positively with future CHF. Additionally, introducing TyG-BMI into conventional prediction models resulted in a substantial improvement of their predictability for cardiovascular outcomes and overall mortality when compared to incorporating TyG or BMI alone. Among T2DM individuals, a higher TyG-BMI is linked strongly to elevated risks of cardiovascular outcomes and overall mortality, highlighting its utility as a predictive marker for these risks."

We aimed to assess the mediating effects of multimorbidity and geographical remoteness in the socioeconomic status (SES)-death associations. A cohort study. All patients with kidney failure aged 18 years and above, who commenced dialysis in Australia from 2005 to 2019. Area-level SES. All-cause and cause-specific death. The effect of SES on all-cause and cause-specific death was analyzed using the inverse probability stabilized weighting. Mediating effects of geographical remoteness, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) on the association between lower SES and all-cause and cause-specific death were explored. A total of 35,239 patients receiving incident dialysis were included, with a median (p25, p75) follow-up period of 3.3 (1.7-5.9) years. Compared with patients from higher SES, the average hazard rate for all-cause death among those from lower SES was 17% higher (total effect [TE]\u00a0=\u00a00.17, 95% CI [0.12-0.23]). Proportions of the effects between SES and all-cause mortality mediated by geographical remoteness, CVD, and DM were 29.4%, 11.8%, 17.6%, respectively, whereas SES explained 41.2% of the TE directly. Compared with patients from high SES, patients from lower SES have on average a higher hazard rate of CVD (TE\u00a0=\u00a00.26, 95% CI, [0.15-0.38]) and infection-related deaths (TE\u00a0=\u00a00.12, 95% CI, [0-0.25]). The effects of SES on CVD and infection-related deaths were mediated by CVD and DM, but not geographical remoteness. Potential residual confounding and other latent mediators. Geographical remoteness, diabetes, and CVD are potential mediators that lie in the pathways between SES and all-cause and cause-specific deaths. A multifaceted approach with sustained efforts from multiple sectors to address these factors may reduce the social disparities observed in patients treated with dialysis."

QOL is a multifaceted system encompassing several dimensions, including social, physical, and psychological functioning, which has emerged as a necessary outcome for children with chronic disorders. This study aimed to understand QOL in Egyptian school-age children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). It examined sociocultural, economic, and healthcare issues faced by these children, revealing unique determinants such as family dynamics and community perceptions in Egypt, which differ from global data. A cross-sectional study was used at the Hospital of Health Insurance outpatient clinics in Banha, Egypt. A group of healthy peers was compared with another group from the outpatient clinic. 412 school children, ages 6 to 12 years, had T1DM, and 412 healthy peer groups with the same child age and gender, the researchers interviewed. Three tools were used: a demographic data sheet, a socioeconomic scale, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scale. The mean age of children was 12.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2. More than 60% of diabetic children had uncontrolled blood glucose levels, and 60% had poor socioeconomic levels. Children with diabetes had a significantly lower QOL than healthy peers in all dimensions. For the duration of the disease, where emotional function from the QOL was only affected, males revealed significantly higher scores related to school functioning. Children with middle and high socioeconomic status showed a highly significant relationship to school, social, and total QOL. T1DM had a negative effect on all QOL domains of the school children.

Mental distress is a leading cause of health-related burden for the Indian population, which is aggravated by a high prevalence of socioeconomic adversity such as physical and sexual abuse, poverty, low education, and gender inequality. The index study was conducted to assess the prevalence and determinants of psychological distress among women in central rural India. The data presented in the index article are a baseline assessment done as part of the community-based pragmatic cluster trial. The study was conducted in the catchment area of three primary health centers, Bela, Borkhedi, and Panchgaon, in the district of Nagpur, Maharashtra. Furthermore, 1050 women members of self-help groups in the district of Nagpur comprised the study population. The mean age of the women was 38.2 years (standard deviation [SD]: 9.8). Around 987 (94%) women have attained primary education, and 52% of the participants were engaged in some occupation. Around half of the men and 10% of the women had the habit of daily tobacco chewing. Around 58.6% of participants' husbands had the habit of drinking alcohol. 62.5% of the female participants were experiencing very high psychological distress. Lower socioeconomic status (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-4.0]), comorbid condition (AOR = 2.0 [95% CI: 1.2-3.3]), marital status of women (single, widowed, divorced) (AOR = 3.4 [95% CI: 1.2-9.4]), and experiencing domestic violence (AOR = 4.7 [95% CI: 1.9-11.2]) were significantly associated with high psychological distress in multivariable logistic regression analysis. The high prevalence of psychological distress among women and its significant association with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and thyroid disorder hints us to incorporate the mechanism to screen for stress routinely at the health and wellness center under Ayushman Bharat, along with other risk factors for non-communicable disease."

We investigated risk of cause-specific mortality associated with AFO\/CAFOs and related disparities for North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (2000-2020). We estimated associations between AFO\/CAFO exposure and mortality (anemia, asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, and kidney disease) using logistic regression. For each participant, we applied two exposure metrics based on buffers around population-weighted ZIP-code centroids: (1) binary exposure based on presence or absence of AFOs\/CAFOs, and (2) exposure intensity (no exposure, low, medium, and high). We investigated health disparities by individual-level (sex, race\/ethnicity, age, education, marital status) and community-level (race, income, poverty, education, racial isolation, educational isolation) characteristics. Presence of AFO\/CAFOs was associated with higher risks of cause-specific mortality, particularly for diabetes mellitus or cerebrovascular disease, across all states. People in ZIP codes within \u2a7d10 km of AFO\/CAFO were 1.028 (95% Confidence Interval 1.014, 1.042), 1.039 (1.025, 1.053), and 1.053 (1.031, 1.075) times more likely to die from cerebrovascular disease compared to those in ZIP codes without AFO\/CAFO exposure for North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, respectively. We found disproportionate health burden associated with AFO\/CAFO exposure in some subpopulations, however results varied by state. Our findings provide evidence of higher mortality risk with high AFO\/CAFO exposure, with some populations facing disproportionate health burden, although such relationships differed by location."

        "Abstract":"To quantify the risk of mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared with those not requiring PPV. A retrospective cohort study utilizing the TriNetX US Collaborative Network. The study included 9081 patients with T2DM who underwent PPV for DR, 363 116 patients with T2DM with DR but no PPV, 92 645 patients with T2DM without DR, and 3 264 709 healthy individuals, all aged \u226518 years. We identified cohorts using specific International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision and Current Procedural Technology codes. We used propensity score matching to adjust for covariates including age, gender, race, ethnicity, systemic pathology, and ocular conditions unrelated to diabetes. The primary outcome measures were the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality, MI, stroke, and amputation at 1, 3, and 5 years after PPV compared with the control groups. Patients with T2DM undergoing PPV for DR had higher risk of systemic events and mortality. Compared with patients with DR not requiring PPV, the PPV cohort had a higher risk at 1 year for stroke (HR: 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 2.21) and amputation (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.16). At 3 years, the risks for MI (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.78), stroke (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.25, 2.07), and amputation (HR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.54, 3.05) were significantly elevated. At 5 years, the risks for mortality (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.43), MI (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.78), stroke (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.91), and amputation (HR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.58, 2.81) were all significantly higher. When compared with diabetic patients without DR or healthy patients, the PPV cohort faced higher risk of each health outcome analyzed at intervals of 1, 3, and 5 years. We found a significant association between patients with T2DM with DR requiring PPV and an increased risk of mortality, MI, stroke, and amputation compared with non-PPV patients with DR, diabetics without DR, and healthy individuals. These findings underscore the need for monitoring and management of systemic health in diabetic patients undergoing PPV for advanced DR.

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, which can not only induce osteoporosis but also accelerate intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Ipriflavone (IP), as a derivative of isoflavones, can not only control the level of blood glucose, but also improve the regulation of osteoporosis and cartilage extracellular matrix metabolism. However, there is no study on whether IP can effectively improve DM with IVDD. Sixty healthy female C57BL\/6J mice were randomly assigned into five groups (Sham, Instability of lumbar spine (ILS), streptozotocin (STZ), ILS + STZ and ILS + STZ + IP groups; 12 per group). The body weight, fasting glucose and blood insulin levels were evaluated in each group of mice. The pathology of DM with IVDD was assessed by Micro-CT (\u03bcCT), Van Gieson (VG) staining, Alcian blue (Ab) staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IP significantly lowed fasting blood glucose and blood insulin levels. Histomorphological analysis revealed that IVDD was significantly exacerbated by the coexistence of ILS and DM, and markedly alleviated by IP. In details, IP markedly improved osteoporosis and microarchitecture of EP and vertebrae. Furthermore, IP ameliorated the cartilage extracellular matrix degradation, significantly increased Aggrecan and Col II expression and decreased the expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS-4. Moreover, IP inhibited EP sclerosis and NP pyroptosis by decreasing Runx2, Osterix, NLRP3, ASC, N-GSDMD and caspase1 expression. The coexistence of ILS and DM further aggravates abnormal metabolic pathology and IVDD, which could be retarded by IP, suggesting that IP may be a potential therapeutic target for amelioration of the progression of DM with IVDD."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an onset metabolic illness in which hyperglycemia occurs due to acquired or inherited impaired insulin production and ineffective action. Diabetes is frequently managed with the use of drugs, which may have adverse consequences even though they are good at regulating blood glucose levels. Herbal remedies are therefore being investigated as a substitute because of their reduced toxicity and fewer adverse effects. Using alloxan-induced diabetic rats, this work intends to investigate the possible anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects of ethanolic and aqueous leaf extracts of <i>Celtis tetrandra<\/i> Roxb. The antidiabetic activity was tested in 35 rats with diabetes induced by a single alloxan injection (140\u2005mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1<\/sup>). Diabetic rats with blood glucose level (BGL >180\u2005mg\/100\u2005mL) were treated with extracts (100 and 200\u2005mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1<\/sup>) and glibenclamide (5\u2005mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1<\/sup>) as a standard drug, and fasting BGL, lipid profiles, body weight, and pancreatic histopathology were assessed. The result was analyzed using SPSS software by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post hoc test, with <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05 being a statistically reliable result. The ethanolic and aqueous leaf extracts of <i>C. tetrandra<\/i> (100 and 200\u2005mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1<\/sup>) significantly reduced BGL, with the 200\u2005mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1<\/sup> ethanolic extract showing the most notable effect at day 21st.

There are limited data on acute kidney injury (AKI) after CTPA in APE patients. The aim was to evaluate frequency and predictors of AKI in patients with the first APE episode. Single-centre, retrospective analysis of APE patients, without haemodynamic instability. Blood tests, including plasma creatinine concentration and clinical evaluation were performed before CTPA and after 48 and 72\u00a0h. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to evaluate right ventricular (RV) function. A total of 411 patients with APE were enrolled. AKI defined by creatine increase \u22650.3\u00a0mg% within 72\u00a0h following CTPA was found in 46 pts (11.2%). Patients with AKI (+) when compared with AKI (-) were characterized by higher sPESI score; more pronounced RV dysfunction; higher plasma concentration of N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and more often suffered from pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus (DM2). The multivariate logistic regression model showed that only: BOVA score {odds ratio (OR) 1.431 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.110; 1.845], P value\u00a0=\u00a00.006}; NT-proBNP\u00a0>\u00a03314\u00a0pg\/mL [OR 3.765 (95% CI, 1.572; 9.016), P value\u00a0=\u00a00.003], while not CKD or sPESI were independent risks factors for AKI.

        "Abstract":"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has become a significant public health issue worldwide, with a pronounced impact in India due to the escalating rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) driving its prevalence. This condition spans a range of hepatic disorders, from uncomplicated steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), accompanied by differing levels of hepatic fibrosis, heightening the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and cardiovascular complications. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD management, pharmacologic therapies are increasingly recognized as essential for patients with progressive disease or those at higher risk of complications. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of MASLD have led to the development of innovative therapies targeting key mechanisms such as hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis. Several pharmacological agents have shown encouraging results in clinical trials, including thyroid hormone receptor-\u03b2 agonist resmetirom, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) like semaglutide, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists such as pioglitazone and saroglitazar, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and vitamin E. Furthermore, emerging therapies, including the dual incretin agonist tirzepatide and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) analogs, hold the potential to transform future treatment strategies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current and evolving pharmacologic options for MASLD, with a focus on practical recommendations tailored for Indian physicians. A structured treatment algorithm for noncirrhotic MASLD (F0-F3 fibrosis) is presented, incorporating only drugs currently available in India and stratified based on diabetes status and hepatic fibrosis severity. Given India's vast and diverse patient population, ensuring access to cost-effective therapies remains a challenge, necessitating a pragmatic approach that balances efficacy, affordability, and real-world feasibility. This review serves as a practical clinical guide, equipping physicians with evidence-based recommendations to optimize MASLD management in routine practice."

According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, NCDs are to account for >60% of all deaths occurring in India. The study aimed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the prevalence of these diseases, dietary habits, physical inactivity, and behaviors such as tobacco use among the cooking staff of midday meals (MDMs) in schools and in finding out their overall knowledge, perception, and practices concerning NCDs such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A cross-sectional study design was implemented with 290 cooking staff from schools in Vijayapura district, Karnataka. Their sociodemographic profiles, diet habits, physical activity, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements were gathered using a prestructured questionnaire. A statistical test package for the social sciences (version 20) was used for the statistical study. The study found that most of the participants (41.4%) were from 30 to 40 years age-group. Overall, 38.3% of the participants were overweight, while 24.1% were classified as obese. Hypertension was observed in 32.4%, and 10.7% of the research participants were prehypertensive. Diabetes was present in 3.4%, and 13.4% of the research participants were prediabetic. Substandard dietary habits, blood pressure, and physical inactivity were seen as the most prevalent modifiable risk factors within these cooking personnel. Increasing knowledge of NCDs can be imposed to implement health promotion programs among cooking staff of MDMs in schools, aiming to reduce the economic and social burdens associated with NCDs."

This study assesses the impact of transition on healthcare quality of people with diabetes, focusing on glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c<\/sub>). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the difference in HbA<sub>1c<\/sub> before and after transition following the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search across four databases for studies of diabetes type 1 and 2 published between 2018 and 2024 was conducted. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies. Twenty studies were included in the systematic review, fifteen to the meta-analysis. Eleven studies considered a structured or semi-structured transition programme: three reported a reduction in HbA<sub>1c<\/sub> (improved glycaemic control) and eight no significant difference. Nine studies considered no transition programme: four showed a worsening of glycaemic control and five no significant difference. Overall, the meta-analysis showed a worsening of glycaemic control post-transition with mean difference (MD) -1.75\u2009mmol\/mol (-0.16%) [95% confidence interval (CI) -5.24-1.75\u2009mmol\/mol (-0.48%-0.16%)], with considerable heterogeneity, where negative values indicate higher HbA<sub>1c<\/sub> post-transition. Subgroup analysis for transition programmes and usual care showed, respectively, significant improvement and worsening of glycaemic control with MD of 3.28\u2009mmol\/mol (0.30%) [95% CI 0.44-6.12\u2009mmol\/mol (0.04%-0.56%)] and -6.99\u2009mmol\/mol (-0.64%) [95% CI -11.79 to -2.19\u2009mmol\/mol (-1.08% to -0.20%)]. Findings suggest that the transition to adult care may negatively affect glycaemic control in emerging adults with diabetes, whereas structured transition programmes can neutralize this effect and prevent consequences. Further investigations are needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for optimizing transition interventions."

        "Abstract":"Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) are two distinct metabolic disorders with unique dietary management requirements. While MSUD necessitates strict restriction of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), T1DM requires precise carbohydrate counting to maintain optimal glycemic control. We report two cases of patients diagnosed with both MSUD and T1DM, highlighting the challenges and strategies in dietary management. Case 1, a 5-year-old girl, was diagnosed with T1DM after presenting with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, despite previously stable MSUD management. The dietary regimen was modified to include a leucine-free amino acid formula and controlled carbohydrate intake to stabilize both leucine and glucose levels. Case 2, an 11-year-old boy with the diagnosis of MSUD, presented with hyperglycemia during a routine follow-up. Dietary management involved increasing the leucine-free formula while reducing carbohydrate intake to maintain metabolic control. Both cases emphasize the importance of individualized dietary plans, integrating BCAA restriction and carbohydrate regulation to prevent metabolic crises and achieve optimal glycemic control. These cases also underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving pediatric endocrinologists, metabolic specialists, and dietitians to navigate the complexities of dual metabolic disorders effectively. Further studies are warranted to explore long-term outcomes and potential therapeutic targets in patients with concurrent MSUD and T1DM."

However, real-world evidence comparing the CV effectiveness and safety of major hypoglycemic drug classes remains limited in this population. This multicenter pooled analysis aims to directly compare the CV outcomes and safety profiles of these key agents in patients with T2D and hypertension. We analyzed electronic health records from two databases in a cohort study of T2D patients with hypertension who had initiated metformin as first-line therapy. Propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risks of 3-\/4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and safety outcomes across drug classes added to metformin: insulin, sulfonylureas (SUs), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is), glinides, acarbose, and sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Compared with insulin, GLP-1 RAs, DPP4is, and glinides were associated with a lower risk of 3-point MACE (HR: 0.48 [0.31-0.76], 0.70 [0.57-0.85], and 0.70 [0.52-0.94], respectively). SUs were associated with a higher risk of 3-point MACE compared with DPP4is (HR: 1.30 [1.06-1.59]). DPP4is, GLP-1 RAs, and glinides showed a lower risk of 3-point MACE compared with acarbose (HR: 0.62 [0.51-0.76], 0.47 [0.29-0.75], and 0.59 [0.43-0.81], respectively). Similar patterns were observed for 4-point MACE. For safety outcomes, DPP4is were associated with a reduced risk of chronic kidney disease, while insulin use was associated with reduced risks of inflammatory polyarthritis and insomnia. However, DPP4is were associated with higher risks of coronary atherosclerotic diseases and hypertensive heart disease. This study highlights the differential cardiovascular effectiveness and safety profiles of hypoglycemic therapies in real-world settings, providing valuable insights for optimizing T2D management, particularly in patients with comorbid hypertension."

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Macrophages infiltrate islets early in T1D pathogenesis, preceding the influx of T- and B-lymphocytes. The integrated stress response (ISR), a cellular pathway activated during stress, coordinates adaptive changes in gene expression to maintain cell function and survival. To study the ISR in macrophages, bone-marrow-derived macrophages were treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of the ISR (ISRIB) and polarized to a proinflammatory M1-like state. We observed a reduction in the number of proinflammatory macrophages, as well as a decrease in iNOS mRNA and protein levels, following ISRIB treatment. RNA-sequencing revealed a reduction in pathways related to stress responses, including ER stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and autophagy, as well as migration pathway genes. ISRIB treatment led to decreased macrophage migration after stimulation in vitro and reduced migration of macrophages to the site of injury after tailfin injury in zebrafish in vivo. Interestingly, ISRIB mediated reduction of M1-like macrophages and reduction of migration was recapitulated by the inhibition of PKR but not PERK, both upstream ISR kinases, highlighting PKR as a key mediator of the ISR in macrophages. Pre-diabetic female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice administered ISRIB demonstrated an overall reduction in the macrophage numbers in the pancreatic islets. Additionally, the insulitic area of pancreata from ISRIB treated NOD mice had increased PD-L1 levels. PD-L1 protein but not mRNA levels were increased in M1-like macrophages after ISR and PKR inhibition. Our findings identify the ISR, particularly via PKR, as a critical regulator of macrophage driven inflammation and migration in T1D. Our study offers new insights into ISR signaling in macrophages, demonstrating that the ISR may serve as a potential target for intervention in macrophages during early T1D pathogenesis."

In this study, we used the gene expression dataset GSE156035 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy controls and patients with T1DM. Functional enrichment analysis, Gene Ontology analysis, and protein-protein interaction network analysis were employed to identify hub genes. We observed significant upregulation and downregulation of DEGs. Upregulated genes were primarily involved in TGF-beta signaling and retinol metabolism, while downregulated genes were associated with MAPK signaling and circadian rhythm pathways. Crucial cellular processes, such as neutrophil activation, defense response to fungi, and neuron differentiation, were highlighted. Hub genes, such as FOS, JUNB, NR4A2, and DUSP1, were identified and showed strong correlations with key signaling pathways. Additionally, elevated levels of angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and hypoxia in T1DM were indicated, along with significant alterations in metabolite levels, including glucose, leucine, and phenylalanine, and their correlations with hub genes. These findings not only identify specific hub genes as key mediators connecting signaling pathways, biological processes, and metabolic changes but also provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of T1DM."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a critical diabetes complication that raises mortality risk, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) settings where metabolic disturbances are more pronounced. The prevalence and economic burden of DN are growing globally, posing a major public health challenge. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and serum calcium (SC) levels, which frequently exhibit significant alterations in critically ill patients, are linked to DN progression. However, the role of the RDW to SC (RCR) ratio in predicting mortality among critically ill DN patients remains understudied. This study aims to explore the RCR index's relationship with mortality in ICU patients with DN, aiding high-risk patient identification and prognostic strategy formulation in critical care settings. Data was sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were categorized into four groups based on their RCR index. Primary endpoints were 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints were 90-day and 180-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to visualize outcomes by quartiles. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) methods assessed the RCR index's impact on prognosis. Subgroup analyses were also conducted. Among 1,265 participants (median age: 73.00 years; 64.27% male), higher RCR index values were associated with increased all-cause mortality risks at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days (Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank P\u2009<\u20090.01). Cox regression revealed higher mortality risks for patients in the highest quartile. RCS analysis showed a linear relationship between the RCR index and all-cause mortality, with inflection points at 2.361 (30-day mortality) and 2.098 (365-day mortality). Specifically, each unit increase below 2.361 in the RCR index was associated with a 414.0% increased 30-day mortality risk (P\u2009<\u20090.001; 95% CI: 3.041-8.688). For 365-day mortality, each additional unit below 2.098 increased risk by 494.2% (P\u2009<\u20090.001; 95% CI: 3.733-9.458). The RCR index exhibits a linear relationship with all-cause mortality in DN patients. It may serve as a useful indicator for assessing disease severity and guiding ICU treatment decisions, enhancing clinician decision-making and patient outcomes."

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), initially developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and weight management, have emerged as a promising treatment due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This review evaluates the clinical efficacy, mechanisms of action, and limitations of GLP-1RAs, such as liraglutide, exenatide, and semaglutide, in the management of psoriasis. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, including evidence from case reports, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohorts, and experimental studies, to assess the role of GLP-1RAs in psoriasis treatment. Evidence suggests that GLP-1RAs mitigate psoriasis severity through systemic effects, including weight loss and improved glycemic control, and local immunomodulation, such as the regulation of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and AMPK activation in psoriatic plaques. These benefits are particularly notable in patients with coexisting metabolic conditions. However, the existing evidence is limited by small cohort sizes, heterogeneous patient populations, and confounding effects of concurrent therapies, limiting its generalizability. GLP-1RAs offer a novel integrative approach to managing psoriasis by targeting both inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Larger, long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to validate their efficacy, optimize dosing, and determine their role as standalone or adjunctive therapies, particularly in patients without metabolic comorbidities."

        "Title":"Performance of a national primary care chronic disease screening strategy in Chile: a mixed-methods analysis.",
        "Abstract":"The continuous increase in chronic non-communicable diseases requires strengthening primary care preventive strategies. In Chile, preventive health screening is a national strategy focused on identifying adults with risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, among others. It is broadly implemented in primary care and has associated performance resources. To evaluate the performance of Chile's primary care preventive health screening for adults and describe healthcare professionals' perceptions regarding its implementation. A parallel convergent mixed-methods study was conducted. The quantitative component employed a retrospective cohort study to assess individuals between 15 and 64 years old who received a preventive health screening in primary care during 2023. Data analysis focused on access and waiting times of the screening pathways. The qualitative component consisted of an online survey to evaluate participants' perceptions of the screening pathways' performance. A total of 36,207 adult individuals received a preventive health screening during 2023, of which 61.5% were reported as completed. Screenings with the highest completion rates (between 99% and 80.1%) were those performed during the check-up day: high blood pressure, overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Access to the second and third steps declines abruptly, with rates between 61.4% and 39.3%, including breast and cervical cancer screenings. The lowest access was to dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus type two screening. Mean waiting times range from 16 to 179 days. The shortest times were from the screening to the first measure of the high blood pressure study and the pap smear test (16 and 18 days, respectively). The longest times were for diagnostic cardiovascular diseases (129 to 179 mean days). Qualitative findings identified that providers perceived that individuals are frequently lost when the screening pathway requires multiple steps, and highlighted the need to develop screening pathway protocols and\u00a0implement strategies to manage the screening pathway proactively. This is the first evaluation of Chile's preventive health screening, demonstrating high implementation but dramatically low completion rates of diagnostic actions after the screening. The policy urgently needs to ensure active follow-up throughout the diagnostic pathway, which can lead to early diagnosis and prevent avoidable complications of cardiovascular disease and cancer."

        "Abstract":"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE is an established treatment for advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). While overall renal safety is high, the kidneys remain an organ at risk. This study aimed to determine whether clinical parameters can predict the risk of PRRT-associated renal function decline. This retrospective single-center study included 178 patients with well-differentiated GEP-NETs (Grade 1 or 2) who completed four cycles of [<sup>177<\/sup>Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE between 2012 and 2023. Mean baseline eGFR was 81.1\u2009\u00b1\u200916.3 mL\/min\/1.73\u00a0m\u00b2 and remained stable at follow-up (81.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.8 mL\/min\/1.73\u00a0m\u00b2, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.989). A KDIGO-defined renal function decline (eGFR follow-up to baseline ratio\u2009<\u20090.8) was observed in 15 patients (8.9%). Higher age at baseline was significantly associated with increased risk (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.14, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.023), while baseline eGFR (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99\u20131.06, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.1) and estimated renal radiation dose (eRRD) (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.89\u20131.21, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.456) were not significant predictors. No significant associations were found for preexisting renal disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or nephrotoxic drugs. ROC analysis yielded an AUC of 0.683 for age, identifying 68.77 years as the optimal threshold for risk stratification of CKD-progression free survival. While the overall risk of renal function decline following [<sup>177<\/sup>Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE therapy of GEP-NET patients is low, age at baseline emerged as a simple yet clinically meaningful predictor of renal function decline in this cohort."

        "Abstract":"Personalized blood glucose (BG) prediction in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is challenged by significant inter-patient heterogeneity. To address this, we propose BiT-MAML, a hybrid model combining a Bidirectional LSTM-Transformer with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. We evaluated our model using a rigorous Leave-One-Patient-Out Cross-Validation (LOPO-CV) on the OhioT1DM dataset, ensuring a fair comparison against re-implemented LSTM and Edge-LSTM baselines. The results show our model achieved a mean RMSE of 24.89 mg\/dL for the 30 min prediction horizon, marking a substantial improvement of 19.3% over the standard LSTM and 14.2% over the Edge-LSTM. Notably, our model also achieved the lowest standard deviation (\u00b14.60 mg\/dL), indicating more consistent and generalizable performance across the patient cohort. A key finding of our study is the confirmation of significant performance variability across individuals, a known clinical challenge. This was evident as our model's 30 min RMSE ranged from an excellent 19.64 mg\/dL to a more challenging 30.57 mg\/dL, reflecting the inherent difficulty of personalizing predictions rather than model instability. From a clinical safety perspective, Clarke Error Grid Analysis confirmed the model's robustness, with over 92% of predictions falling within the clinically acceptable Zones A and B. This study concludes that the development of effective personalized BG prediction requires not only advanced model architectures but also robust evaluation methods that transparently report the full spectrum of performance, providing a realistic pathway toward reliable clinical tools."

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of glibenclamide pretreatment on patients with acute ischemic stroke and T2DM. A total of 122 patients with acute ischemic stroke and T2DM were retrospectively analyzed. Based on medication history, patients were categorized into the glibenclamide group (group 1, n\u2009=\u200954) and the control group (group 2, n\u2009=\u200968). Stroke severity at admission was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and functional status was evaluated with the Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Patients were followed for 3 months. At admission, group 1 demonstrated significantly better neurological function (lower NIHSS) and higher BI scores compared to group 2 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). At 3 months, mortality was 1.9% in group 1 and 5.9% in group 2, though this difference was not statistically significant (\u03c7<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.430, P\u2009=\u20090.512). Adverse events occurred in 7.4% and 10.3% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P\u2009>\u20090.05), with no drug-related deaths or serious safety concerns. The incidence of hemorrhagic transformation also showed no significant difference (P\u2009>\u20090.05). However, group 1 showed significantly better functional outcomes at 3 months, with higher BI scores and lower mRS scores (P\u2009<\u20090.05), suggesting improved independence and neurological recovery. Glibenclamide pretreatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke and T2DM may confer clinical benefits by reducing stroke severity and enhancing post-stroke functional outcomes, without increasing adverse events."

        "Abstract":"Endothelial dysfunction is a known consequence of chronic hyperglycemia and a major pathogenic factor for microvascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. The effect and exposure period to acute hyperglycemia on the vascular endothelium, and its ability to recover from such exposure is less well understood. Here, we used an isolated perfused eye preparation to study the effect of acute hyperglycemia on the ocular microvascular endothelium of normoglycemic and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The acetylcholine (Ach)-induced vasodilatory response was measured during sequential exposure to 6\u00a0mM (normoglycemic), 12\u00a0mM (mild hyperglycemic), 24\u00a0mM (hyperglycemic) and then again to 6\u00a0mM (normoglycemic) perfusates. Eyes were then processed histologically for examination of capillary density, capillary diameter, pericyte distribution, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) distribution and accumulation of advanced glycated end products (AGEs). Ach responses were significantly enhanced in normoglycemic, 1-,2-, 3- and 4-week diabetic eyes after less than 2-h of high glucose (24\u00a0mM) exposure. Upon return to normoglycemia, Ach-induced responses in 1-, 2- and 3-week diabetic eyes were comparable with normoglycemic eyes. In the 4-week diabetic eyes, Ach-induced vasodilatory responses remained significantly enhanced despite restoration of normoglycemia. Capillary density and capillary diameter did not change significantly after 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-weeks of STZ-induced diabetes. Pericyte distribution significantly increased in all vascular layers of the 3- and 4-week diabetic eyes. eNOS immunoreactivity significantly increased in 1-week diabetic eyes. Significant AGEs immunolabelling was detected in the vascular basement membrane and intracellularly in 1-week STZ rats. These findings suggest that whilst endothelial function can recover after short term hyperglycemia, prolonged exposure (\u2265\u20094\u00a0weeks) results in incomplete restoration, indicating a potential transition towards irreversible dysfunction."

        "Abstract":"This study investigates the interplay between drug effects, multimorbidity, frailty and comprehensive geriatric evaluation on zoledronic acid (ZA) treatment success in osteoporosis (OP), particularly among frail, older adults, a group often excluded from research. In this retrospective cohort study, a retrospective analysis of 156 OP-treatment-na\u00efve geriatric outpatients who received their first ZA treatment was conducted. Bone mineral density (BMD) and T-scores in the lumbar, femoral neck and total femur regions were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and patients' fall history was assessed. BMD decrease exceeding the LSC was considered sufficient to define treatment failure, alongside the occurrence of two or more new fragility fractures. In a predominantly female cohort (76%) with a median age of 75\u2009years, 23.1% experienced frailty and 17.3% had malnutrition, yet most remained independent and cognitively intact. Over a median follow-up of 14.4\u00a0months, significant improvements in BMD and reduced fragility fractures were observed, with 70.5% responding successfully to treatment. Univariate analysis identified advanced age, prolonged dosing intervals, illiteracy, multimorbidity, polypharmacy and diabetes mellitus as factors that reduced treatment efficacy. Regression analysis supported these findings, highlighting the complexities of managing OP in older adults. The study emphasizes that identifying barriers to treatment success is crucial for optimizing OP management. ZA improves BMD and reduces fractures, even in frail older adults with multimorbidity, supporting its use across diverse patient profiles and stressing the need for personalized treatment strategies."

Initially, a dose of 150 mg\/kg streptozotocin was tested, and pigs exhibited characteristic triphasic patterns in glycemic responses: phase 1 (transient hyperglycemia), phase 2 (hypoglycemia), and phase 3 (sustained hyperglycemia). Blood glucose levels showed a transient increase in phase 1, and then dropped sharply in phase 2. Based on these findings, we conducted a follow-up study using a reduced streptozotocin dose of 125 mg\/kg. This group exhibited glucose dynamics similar to those observed in the 150\u202fmg\/kg group, showing glucose reductions and mild lethargy. In phase 3, both groups developed sustained hyperglycemia with negligible insulin secretion, confirming the successful establishment of a type 1 DM model."

The patient was initially treated for community-acquired pneumonia but was referred to us when there was no resolution of symptoms. The patient had anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, acute kidney injury, raised D-dimer and C-reactive protein, and a positive cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. After an extensive workup, a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis was made. The patient was treated with oral glucocorticoids for 4 weeks. On follow-up, the patient showed drastic improvement clinically, biochemically and radiologically. Pulmonary infarction can mimic pneumonia and should be considered in patients having risk factors for embolism. A peripheral wedge-shaped opacity (Hampton's hump) is often a classical sign of pulmonary infarction.

Although clinical trials confirm its efficacy, real-world data suggest potential safety concerns. This study evaluates the post-marketing safety profile of ertugliflozin using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). FAERS data from Q1 2004 to Q4 2024 were analyzed. Reports listing ertugliflozin as the primary suspect drug were included. Duplicate and incomplete records were excluded. Disproportionality analyses were conducted using reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM), and information component (IC). Adverse events (AEs) were classified using MedDRA. A total of 671 reports were analyzed, encompassing 25 system organ classes and 159 preferred terms. Significant safety signals included fungal infections (ROR\u00a0=\u00a078.6), urinary tract infections (ROR\u00a0=\u00a011.3), Fournier's gangrene (ROR\u00a0=\u00a0267.2), diabetic ketoacidosis (ROR\u00a0=\u00a067.6), and ketosis (ROR\u00a0=\u00a0295.5). Renal AEs, notably pollakiuria (ROR\u00a0=\u00a017.1), were also observed. Serious AEs constituted 31.5\u00a0% of reports, primarily hospitalizations (20.1\u00a0%). Females (50.8\u00a0%) and patients aged \u226545 years (36.5\u00a0%) were more frequently affected. Notably, 57.6\u00a0% of AEs occurred within 30 days of treatment initiation. Ertugliflozin is associated with increased risks of metabolic, infectious, and renal adverse events, including some that are potentially life-threatening. Clinicians are advised to monitor ketone levels during the initial treatment period and to assess patients for a history of genital fungal infections prior to initiation. These steps may help mitigate early adverse events in high-risk populations. Further investigation is warranted to clarify causal pathways and inform safer clinical use."

This study revealed the potential mechanism of abnormal glucose metabolism due to acute PCB-153 exposure in HepG2 cells through integrated transcriptome and DNA methylation analysis. Based on a joint analysis of two omics, the random forest machine learning model was established with 200 trees and cross-validated five times. Potential biomarkers identified by machine learning pointed to impaired mitochondrial function. Subsequent validation confirmed PCB-153-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATPase activity, alongside altered morphology and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Critically, abnormal glucose metabolism was significantly attenuated and even recovered to control levels after enhancement of mitochondrial function, suggesting that PCB-153 promoted glucose metabolic defects in relation to mitochondrial dysfunction. The decline of mtDNAcn in the T2DM nested case-control population provided further evidence for long-term PCBs exposure inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, significant multiplicative and additive interactions were observed between mtDNAcn and PCB-138, PCB-153, lowly chlorinated PCBs, highly chlorinated PCBs, \u03a3NDL-PCBs on the 5-year FBG levels changes (P<sub>interaction<\/sub>: 0.004-0.03; RERI: -0.44 to -0.31; AP: -0.39 to -0.21).

To investigate the association of the rs.11196205 polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene with biochemical and anthropometric parameters and cardiovascular risk indices in Brazilian patients with SAH and T2DM. The polymorphism was identified by qPCR in 664 samples from four groups: Control (CG-without diabetes or hypertension), diabetic (DG-normotensive), hypertensive (HG-without diabetes) and hypertensive diabetic (HDG), using the TaqMan\u00ae system. Biochemical dosages were taken for the lipid profile: triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and uric acid. Anthropometric measurements were taken for body mass index (BMI), visceral fat index and cardiovascular risk calculations, including the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), visceral adiposity index (VAI), triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and uric acid\/HDL-c ratio (UA\/HDL). Bivariate logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with SAH and T2DM. Subsequent categorical variables were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. The GG genotype of the rs.11196205 variant of the TCF7L2 gene was associated with an increased risk of hypertension and diabetic hypertension. Patients in the GHD group with the GG genotype showed worsening BMI parameters and TyG index values.

Their impact in orthopedic surgery, particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA), remains underexplored. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the influence of GLP1RAs on 90-day medical complications and 2-year surgical outcomes following TKA. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using a national all-payer claims database. Patients who underwent primary TKA were stratified into two groups: patients who received a GLP1RA within 6\u00a0months prior to surgery (GLP-1 cohort) and patients who did not have a GLP1RA history. Outcomes included the incidence of 90-day readmission and medical complications, and 2-year surgical complications. Univariate and multivariable regression analysis was conducted to compare outcomes. Patients in the GLP-1 cohort exhibited a lower 90-day readmission rate (OR: 0.77; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and fewer medical complications such as arrhythmia (OR: 0.78), death (OR: 0.24), and deep vein thrombosis (OR: 0.70) compared to the control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for all). However, they experienced a higher odds of acute renal failure (OR: 1.16; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). No significant differences were observed in 2-year surgical outcomes. GLP1RAs use is associated with a reduced incidence of certain 90-day medical complications following TKA. We believe that this is likely due to their effects on weight loss and glycemic control. However, they are associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure. GLP1RAs do not appear to influence long-term surgical outcomes, suggesting their benefits are primarily confined to the early postoperative period."

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated low-dose glucagon's efficacy for preventing and treating exercise-induced hypoglycemia in T1D. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials and crossover studies until September 2024. The analysis included T1D adolescents and adults treated with low-dose glucagon versus nonglucagon treatments. Studies with glucagon-like peptides, noninsulin combinations, or uncontrolled exercise settings were excluded. Two authors extracted the data. The methodological quality was assessed with the Risk of Bias-2 tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. Risk of Bias 2 informed a sensitivity analysis. The meta-analysis employed a random effects model to estimate the pooled treatment effects on hypoglycemia and time below range (TBR) (glucose <3.9 mmol\/L), as well as secondary outcomes and adverse effects. Of 6,792 records, 12 studies involving 248 individuals (mean age: 36 \u00b1 10.5 years) met inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed significant reductions in hypoglycemia risk (risk ratio 0.54; 95% CI 0.35, 0.84) and TBR (-3.91 percentage points; 95% CI -6.27, 1.54) with low-dose glucagon. Sensitivity analysis yielded a slightly more confident effect size for hypoglycemia and TBR. However, overall adverse events increased with low-dose glucagon (risk ratio 2.75; 95% CI 1.07, 7.08). The included studies were few and heterogeneous, which may have influenced the overall outcomes. Low-dose glucagon reduces exercise-induced hypoglycemia and TBR in T1D individuals. Future research should optimize glucagon dosage and timing for various exercise types and durations to confirm real-world effectiveness."

Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats (n = 22) weighing 200-300 g through a streptozotocin injection (55 mg\/kg). The animals received sub-doses of long-acting insulin to induce a moderate, chronic diabetic state. A DFU was surgically created on the animal's paws (1 \u00d7 1 cm). The animals were divided into two groups: a control group treated with gauze and 0.9% saline solution (n = 10), and the frog skin group (n = 12). Both groups were further subdivided so it was possible to analyze their healing on postoperative 7 and 14 days (POD7 and POD14). The primary endpoints assessed included DFU contraction area, histological analysis, and gene expression. On POD14, the frog skin group showed six times less contracture when compared to the control group. Histological analysis revealed a 30% increase in neoangiogenesis and 50% reduction in inflammation in the POD14 frog skin group when compared to the control group. Additionally, on POD7, Il10 expression was about five times higher in the frog skin group compared to the respective control (p = 0.011). This study suggests that the use of frog skin as temporary biological dressing can reduce DFU secondary contraction and inflammation, offering potential therapeutic benefits for chronic wound management."

Glucose to lymphocyte ratio (GLR), a novel promising marker, has been recognized as a reliable predictor of prognosis in various cancers. However, there are still no studies on the association of cardiovascular disease with GLR. This analysis aimed to uncover the potential association between GLR and the risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in a ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) population. Clinical data of 592 nondiabetic STEMI patients managed with PPCI from February 2021 to February 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with end-stage kidney disease, missing laboratory data, cancers, inflammatory\/infectious diseases, or died during the procedure or within 24 hours after the procedure were excluded. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff of GLR in CI-AKI. Based on the cutoff value, the study population was categorized into high-GLR (\u22654.16) and low-GLR (<4.16) groups. The level of significance adopted in the statistical analysis was 5%. The overall CI-AKI incidence was 7.4%. The high-GLR group showed a higher CI-AKI incidence in comparison to the low-GLR group (30.9%vs1.3%, p<0.001). Following adjustment for potential confounders, high-GLR still served as an independent predictor for CI-AKI (odds ratio [OR] 45.100, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.312-278.174, p<0.001), as well as creatinine at admission (OR:10.459, 95%CI 1.169-93.583, p=0.036). In conclusion, a high GLR level served as an independent risk factor for CI-AKI evolution after PPCI in subjects with STEMI without diabetes mellitus."

Orientin, a water-soluble flavonoid present in many medicinal plants, exerts various pharmacological effects. To investigate the cardioprotective effects of orientin in diabetic conditions and elucidate the mechanisms associated with non-coding RNAs. The streptozotocin-induced DCM model was established by a combined use of streptozotocin and a high-fat diet. Cardiac structure and function in diabetes mellitus mice were evaluated using histological and echocardiographic analyses. Masson, TUNEL, western blot, and ELISA in mouse hearts were performed to analyze cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Expression levels of lncRNA H19, miR-103-3p, ALDH2, and PI3K\/AKT-related proteins in mouse heart and HL-1 cells were evaluated using real-time qPCR or western blot. The significance level was set at p<0.05. Orientin improved cardiac function and ameliorated cardiac injury in diabetic mice. Orientin inhibited cardiac fibrosis, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes. In pathological conditions, H19 and ALDH2 levels were reduced while miR-103-3p levels increased, which were reversed by orientin. H19 upregulated ALDH2 expression by binding to miR-103-3p and activated the PI3K\/AKT pathway in high glucose-treated HL-1 cells.

        "Abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, with substantial social and economic impacts. These conditions are frequently associated with comorbidities, including renal dysfunction. To evaluate the association between creatinine clearance and the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes within 1 year in patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This prospective cohort study included patients hospitalized for their first AMI. Creatinine clearance was assessed in relation to cardiovascular outcomes, including recurrent AMI, stroke, and cardiovascular death. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 1,324 patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 60.9 \u00b1 11.4 years; 67.4% were male. Creatinine clearance <60 mL\/min was significantly associated with systemic arterial hypertension (79.6% vs. 55.1%, p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (40.8% vs. 24.5%, p<0.001), and dyslipidemia (38.8% vs. 31.4%, p=0.043). Higher creatinine clearance values were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year (HR: 0.992; 95% CI: 0.984-0.999; p=0.030). Additionally, higher clearance was linked to lower overall mortality (HR: 0.984; 95% CI: 0.970-0.998; p=0.021). Higher creatinine clearance values are associated with a lower hazard ratio for MACE and overall mortality within 1 year following AMI."

        "Abstract":"Regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells) have potential as a cell-based therapy to prevent or treat transplant rejection and autoimmunity. Using a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (A2-CAR), we previously showed that adoptive transfer of A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells can limit anti-HLA-A2 alloimmunity. However, it was unknown whether A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells could also limit immunity to autoantigens. Using a model of HLA-A2<sup>+<\/sup> islet transplantation into immunodeficient nonobese diabetic mice, we investigated whether A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells could control hyperglycemia induced by diabetogenic BDC2.5 effector T cells. In mice transplanted with HLA-A2<sup>+<\/sup> islets, A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells reduced BDC2.5 T cell engraftment, proliferation, and cytokine production and protected mice from diabetes. Islet tolerance was systemic, including protection of the HLA-A2<sup>negative<\/sup> endogenous pancreas. Treated mice remained euglycemic even after removal of the HLA-A2<sup>+<\/sup> islet graft and A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells. Thus, A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells can induce linked suppression and long-lasting tolerance to a distinct autoimmune antigen. Tolerance to the autoantigen does not require A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> persistence, indicating the presence of infectious tolerance. Overall, these data demonstrate that A2-CAR T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells have potential therapeutic use to simultaneously control both allo- and autoimmunity in islet transplantation."

In the cross-sectional study of community-dwelling adults aged\u2009\u2265\u200960 years in New Taipei City, Taiwan, Sarcopenia status was classified using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria into possible sarcopenia, sarcopenia, and severe sarcopenia. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using chi-square\/Fisher's exact tests and ANOVA. Sex-specific associations between glycemic control and sarcopenia were examined using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 5,728 participants (mean age 72.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 years; 47.9% men) were enrolled. After adjustment, older women with T2DM had a higher odds of possible sarcopenia (OR\u2009=\u20092.07, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.57-2.72). In women aged\u2009\u2265\u200970 years, both good and poor glycemic control were significantly correlated with possible sarcopenia (OR\u2009=\u20091.87 and 2.10; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.16-3.04 and 1.43-3.07; p for trend\u2009<\u20090.0001). T2DM patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease (IHD), or depression showed increased sarcopenia association (OR\u2009=\u20091.71, 1.81, and 2.45, respectively). Poor glycemic control revealed increased odds of sarcopenia in those with hypertension (OR\u2009=\u20091.80) or IHD (OR\u2009=\u20092.42). Glycemic control could be crucial in preventing possible sarcopenia, especially among older women with T2DM. Comorbid hypertension, IHD, or depression are significantly associated with sarcopenia in T2DM patients, particularly in the presence of poor glycemic control."

This cross-sectional study included 409 community-dwelling older adults with T2D (mean age: 71.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 years; 207 men, 202 women). IC was assessed using the WHO framework across five domains: cognition (Brain Health Test), locomotion (Short Physical Performance Battery), vitality (Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form), sensory (vision and hearing tests), and psychological function (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale). Each impaired domain contributed one point to the total IC impairment score (range: 0-5), with higher scores indicating greater IC decline. Sarcopenia was defined based on the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria, including muscle mass, grip strength, and physical performance. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between IC impairment and sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 13.4%, and the average IC impairment score was 0.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8. The most common impairments were hearing (42.1%) and vision (13.2%). Participants with sarcopenia had a significantly higher number of IC impairments. A greater number of impaired IC domains was associated with increased odds of sarcopenia. While locomotion and visual impairments showed a positive association, they were not statistically significant after adjusting for confounders. Declines in IC, particularly in locomotion and sensory domains, were associated with higher likelihood of sarcopenia in older adults with T2D. Routine IC assessment may support early detection and preventive interventions in this high-risk population."

        "Abstract":"Approximately 19% of the global adult population is affected by periodontal diseases. Healing is a protracted process that is significantly influenced by the patient's motivation, proficiency, and cooperation. The prevalence of periodontal diseases in patients with diabetes mellitus is extremely high, and the relationship is bidirectional. In previous investigations, metformin (MF), a biguanide antidiabetic medicine, has demonstrated promising results when administered locally to periodontal defects. The study aimed to systematically assess available literature that evaluate the effectiveness of 1% metformin gel in the treatment of periodontal disease. We attempted to include clinical trials on patients with periodontitis treated with local administration of 1% metformin gel, compared to a placebo. Using identical MeSH terms, we conducted a systematic search in three databases. Our analysis encompassed human studies that measured the periodontal pocket depth, the clinical attachment level, and the depth of the intra-bony defect. Meta-analyses were carried out using random effects model to compare the mean differences between the study group, which received 1% MF gel locally in addition to traditional scaling and root planing (SRP), and the control group, which received a placebo in addition to conventional treatment. Following the selection procedure, six articles were selected for inclusion in our meta-analysis, out of the 246 articles identified through the systematic search. After three and six months of follow-up, meta-analyses revealed statistically significant differences between the control and study groups. The overall effect for PD was a 1.33\u00a0mm reduction (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.66; -1.01) after three months and 1.87\u00a0mm (-2.24; -1.39) after six months. The overall effect of CAL was 1.80\u00a0mm (-2.26; -1.34) after three months and 2.14\u00a0mm (-2.71; -1.58) after six months. The change in IBD after a six-month follow-up was 1.16\u00a0mm (-1.40; -0.92). The application of 1% MF gel enhances the healing process in periodontal diseases, when employed in conjunction with conventional therapy."

This study employed genetic approaches to investigate potential causal associations between mtDNA-CN and various GMDs. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from large-scale populations: mtDNA-CN (n\u00a0=\u00a0395\u00a0718), preeclampsia (PE) (n\u00a0=\u00a0267\u00a0242), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (n\u00a0=\u00a0123\u00a0579), gestational hypertension (GH) (n\u00a0=\u00a0118\u00a0990), hyperlipidemia (n\u00a0=\u00a09714), and obesity (n\u00a0=\u00a0463\u00a0010). Independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were rigorously selected as instrumental variables (IVs) following stringent criteria. The primary analysis employed the fixed-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. Multiple sensitivity analyses, including leave-one-out analysis, Cochran's Q test, and MR-Egger regression, were conducted to assess the robustness of our findings. The IVW analysis revealed a significant protective association between increased mtDNA-CN and PE risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.6262, 95% CI: 0.4201-0.9335, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0283). However, no significant associations were observed between mtDNA-CN and other GMDs (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), supporting the robustness of our findings. This genetic investigation provides compelling evidence for a potentially protective effect of higher mtDNA-CN against PE development. These findings not only suggest mtDNA-CN as a promising biomarker for PE risk assessment but also offer novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying PE, potentially informing future preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions."

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Ankara Etlik City Hospital, including 1173 pregnant women, of whom 576 (49.1%) were diagnosed with GDM and 597 (50.9%) served as controls. LGI, APRI, and FIB-4 scores were calculated using first- and second-trimester laboratory data. Statistical analyses, including logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, were performed to assess their predictive value for GDM and neonatal outcomes. LGI was significantly lower in the GDM group during both the first and second trimesters (p < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated that LGI had a statistically modest discriminative ability for GDM (AUC = 0.583 and 0.609 for the first and second trimesters, respectively, p < 0.001). However, FIB-4 and APRI indices were not significant predictors of GDM. First-trimester APRI scores were significantly associated with adverse neonatal outcomes (AUC = 0.607, p = 0.004). LGI was identified as a potential predictive marker for GDM, supporting its role as an inflammation-related index in GDM risk assessment. While APRI scores in the first trimester correlated with adverse neonatal outcomes, FIB-4, and APRI indices were not effective predictors of GDM. Further prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and explore the clinical applicability of LGI in early GDM screening."

This study encompassed 2897 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with diabetes at the Department of Endocrinology, Ningbo No.2 Hospital. Patients with MASLD were matched to patients without MASLD based on age and sex. GV was evaluated utilizing glucose standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2 indices were used to assess insulin resistance and islet \u03b2-cell function. The degree of hepatic fibrosis was graded using the FIB-4 score. SPSS software (version 26.0) was used for the statistical analysis. 1. MASLD was diagnosed in 41.66% of T2DM inpatients. Among individuals with normal body weight, 32.45% suffered from MASLD, whereas the prevalence significantly escalated to 77.55% among those classified as obese.

To estimate the economic burden of diabetes, including direct and indirect costs, in the 22 EMR countries and territories. A prevalence-based approach was used to estimate the annual direct and indirect costs of diabetes in the EMR from 2023 to 2050. Data were sourced from international, open-access databases. Mortality costs were estimated using the value of a statistical life-year approach. In 2023, diabetes affected more than 74 million people in the EMR and caused approximately 833 000 deaths. By 2050, diabetes cases are projected to reach 150 million, with associated deaths rising to 2 million. The economic burden in 2023 was estimated at 639 billion international dollars (Int$), 89% of which was attributable to indirect costs. By 2050, the burden is expected to reach Int$ 1.5 trillion.

There are areas of uncertainty in the management of this condition, which this review seeks to address by reviewing relevant literature from the last 18 months. Data on prevalence from recent meta-analyses are in line with previous studies. Individual TSH reference ranges are influenced by genetic factors, which suggests that current reference ranges may be leading to misdiagnosis. Further research has increased the strength of evidence for the association with atrial fibrillation. A meta-analysis has shown increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Data support an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and dementia. A randomised controlled trial has recently been conducted to investigate the effect of treatment on atrial fibrillation incidence, in which post hoc-analysis showed normalisation of TSH decreased risk of atrial fibrillation. Degree of TSH suppression is an important element of clinical assessment. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and dementia.

Studies validating prognostic models that predicted all cause and cardiovascular mortality, admission to hospital for heart failure, kidney failure, myocardial infarction, or ischaemic stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including people with established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, or both. Risk models evaluating composite outcomes were not eligible. For each model and outcome, using a random effects model, the reported discrimination measures were pooled, reported as c statistics. Furthermore, when available, calibration plots were reconstructed and interpreted narratively. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment (PROBAST) tool was used to assess the risk of bias of each analysed study cohort and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to evaluate our certainty in the evidence. 6529 publications were identified, of which 35 studies reporting on 13 models were included, all of which were developed for general populations with type 2 diabetes but no established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. Among the identified models, the Risk Equations for Complications of Type 2 Diabetes (RECODe) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2 (UKPDS-OM2) evaluated all outcomes except for admission to hospital for heart failure. Relative to a threshold c statistic of 0.7, RECODe had an acceptable discrimination for cardiovascular mortality (0.79, high certainty), probably has an acceptable discrimination for myocardial infarction (0.72, moderate certainty) and stroke (0.71, moderate certainty), and may have an acceptable discrimination for kidney failure (0.76, low certainty). High certainty evidence suggests that UKPDS-OM2 has unacceptable discrimination for myocardial infarction (0.64) and stroke (0.65). RECODe showed acceptable calibration for cardiovascular mortality (high certainty), myocardial infarction (high certainty), and kidney failure (moderate certainty) but had unacceptable calibration for stroke (moderate certainty). UKPDS-OM2 showed acceptable calibration for cardiovascular mortality (moderate certainty), stroke (moderate certainty), and kidney failure (low certainty), but may have unacceptable calibration for myocardial infarction (moderate certainty). 13 unique models were identified that evaluated cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Two models, RECODe and UKPDS-OM2, evaluated all outcomes except for admission to hospital for heart failure. Of all the appraised prognostic models, RECODe had acceptable discrimination and calibration in validation studies for most outcomes; although, additional studies directly comparing models are needed.

        "Abstract":"To assess the comparative effectiveness of zoledronic acid <i>vs<\/i>. denosumab in prevention of major osteoporotic fractures and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes. The study population was identified by crosslinking the diabetes and osteoporosis registries of a large healthcare organization in Israel. Demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), diabetes complications, bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores, hemoglobin A1c levels, eGFR, purchase of statins and anti-resorptive agents were collected. Exposure groups were matched using propensity score. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to assess the time from treatment initiation to outcomes. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazards survival models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for each outcome. Among 27503 patients with concurrent osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes, 627 (4.7%) received zoledronic acid and 502 (3.7%) denosumab. Prior to matching, the denosumab-treated patients were older (mean age 75.7 <i>vs<\/i> 71.9, p<0.01), had longer diabetes duration (mean 8.4 <i>vs<\/i> 7.2 years, p<0.01), and had a lower baseline eGFR (59.4 <i>vs<\/i> 75.3, p<0.01) than the zoledronic acid-treated patients. After matching, 415 pairs of subjects were included. The incidence of all examined outcomes was similar in the Zol and Dmab treatment groups, including 5-year cumulative incidence of fractures (38% <i>vs<\/i> 31%), death events (36% <i>vs<\/i> 41%), overall fracture risk (HR=1.17, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.75), death risk (HR= 1.12, 95% CI:0.87 to 1.44), and mortality after a hip fracture (HR= 0.92, 95% CI:0.37-2.29). Our findings suggest comparability of Zoledronic Acid and Denosumab in managing osteoporotic fractures and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes."

        "Abstract":"By analyzing the expression levels of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its correlation with diabetic osteoporosis (DOP), this study aims to identify potential biomarkers for the early prediction and screening of DOP. A total of 120 patients with T2DM who received treatment in the endocrinology outpatient\/inpatient department between January 2023 and June 2024, along with 90 healthy volunteers, were enrolled in this study. Based on the bone mineral density (BMD), the 120 T2DM patients were divided into three groups: normal group (54 cases), osteopenia group (38 cases), and osteoporosis group (28 cases). The differences in clinical data, laboratory test indicators and miRNA expression differences among the three groups were statistically analyzed, and the high-risk factors for DOP in T2DM patients were analyzed. Compared to healthy volunteers, patients with T2DM demonstrated significantly decreased levels of P1NP and miR-219a-5p, alongside elevated levels of \u03b2-CTX, miR-188-3p, and miR-19a\/b. Additionally, miR-335-5p levels were notably reduced in T2DM patients. Among these markers, significant differences were observed in the expression levels of P1NP, \u03b2-CTX, and miRNA in T2DM patients. Further analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of miR-188-3p, miR-335-5p, and miR-19a\/b across the three T2DM subgroups (osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal bone density groups). Specifically, miR-188-3p levels were 10.34 \u00b1 1.26 in the osteoporosis group, 8.35 \u00b1 1.33 in the osteopenia group, and 6.55 \u00b1 1.18 in the normal group. Similarly, miR-335-5p levels were 0.44 \u00b1 0.14, 0.67 \u00b1 0.16, and 0.88 \u00b1 0.15, respectively, while miR-19a\/b levels were 4.04 \u00b1 1.41, 3.19 \u00b1 1.21, and 2.47 \u00b1 1.24, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). These miRNAs also exhibited significant correlations with BMD at the hip and lumbar spine (P < 0.001 or P = 0.001), highlighting their potential role in bone metabolism and osteoporosis risk in T2DM patients. The results suggest that the circulating levels of miR-188-3p, miR-335-5p, and miR-19a\/b are significantly associated with the occurrence of DOP in T2DM patients. These miRNAs show potential as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of DOP."

        "Title":"A review of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cognitive impairment.",
        "Abstract":"The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cognitive impairment represents a critical public health concern, particularly against the backdrop of the rising global prevalence of diabetes and aging populations. Accumulating evidence indicates that T2DM is linked to declines in multiple cognitive domains, which may progress to cognitive impairment or even dementia. This cognitive impairment arises from complex interactions among insulin resistance, chronic inflammatory responses, vascular injury and microangiopathy and oxidative stress. Clinical studies suggest that strict glycemic control combined with behavioral and lifestyle interventions may delay cognitive decline, though their long-term efficacy requires further evidence-based validation. Future research should leverage multi-omics technologies to identify early biomarkers for T2DM-related cognitive impairment, elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, identify specific therapeutic targets, and develop personalized intervention strategies. This review systematically examines the epidemiological correlations, pathophysiological mechanisms, and advances in clinical management of T2DM-related cognitive disorders, with the aim of providing a theoretical foundation for early prevention and targeted treatment."

        "Abstract":"Gene mutations in the Janus kinase\/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling (JAK\/STAT) pathway can promote the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and autoimmune diseases. We report on two patients with T2DM (a mother and her adult son) with concomitant Hashimoto's thyroiditis and autoimmune diseases. The son was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis and antiphospholipid syndrome, while the mother was diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis. Both diagnoses occurred simultaneously. These cases highlight that, in clinical practice, careful symptom assessment, thorough history-taking, standardized physical examination, and obtaining a detailed family history are important. This reduces the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates, enabling early diagnosis and treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes. While genetic testing was not performed in these two patients, this represents a potential direction for future research."

        "Abstract":"Background Hypertension is a major global public health concern and a leading risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines for hypertension management, discrepancies often exist between recommended practices and real-world prescribing patterns. This study aimed to evaluate the prescription pattern of antihypertensive drugs in patients attending the outpatient department (OPD) of medicine at a tertiary care hospital and to assess the adherence of prescribed therapies to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines. Methods This was a cross-sectional, single-center, observational study conducted over two years, with data collection spanning six months (April to September 2023) in the OPD of medicine\u00a0of a tertiary care hospital. A total of 334 patients diagnosed with primary hypertension, meeting the inclusion criteria, were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. Data were collected from printed hospital management information system (HMIS)-generated prescriptions, which included diagnosis, past history, and antihypertensive treatment, along with patient interviews. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and antihypertensive prescriptions were collected and analyzed. Prescriptions were also evaluated for adherence to JNC 8 guidelines. Results Among 334 patients, 182 (54.49%) were male and 152 (45.51%) were female, with a mean age of 57.2 \u00b1 11.39 years. The majority (57.49%) belonged to the 40-60 years age group. A total of 536 antihypertensive drugs were prescribed, with an average of 1.60 \u00b1 0.65 drugs per prescription. Among the 334 prescriptions analyzed, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were the most commonly prescribed class (76.95%), followed by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (60.18%), diuretics (27.25%), beta-blockers (BBs) (18.26%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\u00a0(ACEIs) (5.99%), and alpha-blockers (0.6%). Monotherapy was prescribed in 36.23% of cases, while 63.77% received combination therapy, with two-drug combinations being most common (41.62%). Among monotherapy prescriptions, CCBs were preferred (71.9%), followed by ARBs (20.66%). The most frequent two-drug combination was CCB + ARB (61.87%), while the three-drug combination of CCB + ARB + diuretic was most common (60.66%). In four-drug combinations, CCB + ARB + BB + diuretic was most frequently used (76.93%). Comorbidities were present in 52.69% of patients, with diabetes mellitus (68.18%) being the most prevalent. In diabetic hypertensive patients, CCBs (80.83%) were most commonly prescribed; 82.63% of prescriptions adhered to JNC 8 guidelines. Conclusion The study revealed a high prevalence of CCB and ARB use, both as monotherapy and combination therapy, in accordance with national and international guidelines. However, prescribing trends were influenced by factors such as physician preference, comorbidities, and individual clinical judgment. Regular prescription audits and awareness programs focusing on evidence-based guidelines are essential to ensure rational antihypertensive drug use and optimal patient outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Pulmonary mucormycosis is a rare but aggressive fungal infection that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, especially those with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Its non-specific presentation can mimic more common pulmonary conditions, often resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a case series of three Sri Lankan patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed pulmonary mucormycosis. Each case demonstrated variable respiratory and constitutional symptoms. Imaging, primarily chest radiography and contrast-enhanced CT, revealed findings such as cavitary lesions and pleural effusions. Diagnosis was confirmed via bronchoscopic or surgical sampling, with fungal stains showing broad, non-septate hyphae characteristic of mucormycosis. Two patients were successfully treated with prolonged intravenous liposomal amphotericin B therapy. One patient, however, rapidly deteriorated and died despite early antifungal initiation. This series underscores the importance of early clinical suspicion and tissue diagnosis in suspected invasive fungal infections among diabetic patients. In resource-limited and endemic settings, timely recognition and intervention remain crucial for improving patient outcomes."

We report the case of a 59-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and stage IVA cervical cancer who presented with fever and dyspnea with acute onset, two days following ureteral stent placement. Clinical examination revealed costovertebral angle tenderness and dark red urine. Laboratory findings demonstrated hemolysis, renal dysfunction, and elevated inflammatory markers. Urinary Gram stain revealed Gram-positive rods, and computed tomography demonstrated gas in the right renal pelvis. Blood cultures yielded <i>C. perfringens<\/i>, yet urine cultures remained negative. The patient developed circulatory collapse requiring intensive care management. Following antimicrobial therapy and stent replacement, she stabilized and was discharged from the intensive care unit\u00a0after six days. This case highlights <i>C. perfringens<\/i> as a potential cause of healthcare-associated urinary tract infections in high-risk patients. The occurrence of negative urine cultures despite active infection underscores the necessity for anaerobic culture techniques, while intravascular hemolysis provides valuable diagnostic clues. Clinicians should consider anaerobic pathogens in urinary tract infections with unusual presentations, particularly in patients with malignancy, diabetes, or recent urological interventions."

        "Abstract":"Vitamin B12 deficiency is a recognized complication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing long-term metformin therapy. Despite metformin's widespread use due to its efficacy and safety profile, it has been associated with reduced absorption of vitamin B12, which can lead to hematologic and neurologic complications. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency and its associated risk factors among T2DM patients on prolonged metformin therapy in Peshawar, Pakistan. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the outpatient departments of tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar from October 2024 to April 2025. A total of 320 T2DM patients aged 18 years and above who had been on metformin therapy were included. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and medical records, and serum vitamin B12 levels were measured using blood samples. Deficiency was defined as <200 pg\/mL, borderline as 200-300 pg\/mL, and normal as >300 pg\/mL. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US), applying chi-square tests to assess associations. Out of 329 participants, 65.7% (n=216) had vitamin B12 deficiency, 24.3% (n=80) had borderline levels, and only 10% (n=33) had normal vitamin B12 levels. A statistically significant association was found between vitamin B12 deficiency and increasing age (p=0.003), higher BMI (p=0.012), longer duration of diabetes (p=0.025), and prolonged metformin use (p<0.001). The study reveals a high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency among T2DM patients on long-term metformin therapy. The deficiency is significantly associated with older age, obesity, longer diabetes duration, and extended metformin use. Routine screening and early supplementation of vitamin B12 should be considered in diabetic patients on prolonged metformin treatment to prevent potential complications."

The current study observes the signs and symptoms of patients with hypothyroidism who are positive for hypothyroidism according to the Zulewski\u00a0clinical score, and determines associations between thyroid and lipid profiles. The current prospective cohort study was conducted among newly diagnosed hypothyroid patients aged 18-65 years with a Zulewski score > 5 (indicative of hypothyroidism) and biochemically diagnosed as hypothyroid. Demographics, thyroid, and lipid profiles of the patients were recorded and analysed. A P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The current study included 100 patients with hypothyroidism (M:F = 1:1.94), with an average age of 40.9 \u00b1 12.1 years. Slow movement and coarse skin were the most common signs among men (67.6%) and women (68.2%), respectively. Weight gain was the most common symptom (M: 91.2%; F: 87.9%). The TSH levels of patients significantly increased with higher Zulewski scores. A deranged lipid profile was observed in 86% of patients. A positive correlation was observed between total cholesterol and TSH (r = 0.275; P = 0.006), and between total cholesterol and T4 (r = -0.205; P = 0.041). A negative correlation was observed between T3 and cholesterol (r = -0.263; P = 0.008), and between T3 and triglycerides (r = -0.263; P = 0.008). The current study highlights the reliability of the Zulewski score for early diagnosis and risk assessment in Indian patients with hypothyroidism. It could also serve as an indirect clinical measure to assess deranged lipid parameters and identify the risk of atherosclerosis among hypothyroid patients."

        "Abstract":"The fourth heart sound (S4) is an auscultatory marker of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Additionally, S4 correlates with atrial function, which is typically impaired in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) but can improve with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy. This case report highlights the dynamic changes in S4 associated with modification of SGLT2i therapy. An 83-year-old male with T2D and LVDD, confirmed via echocardiography, was treated with SGLT2i therapy for 4\u2009years for glycemic control. The therapy was discontinued in December 2023 because of increased nocturnal urination. Two months after discontinuation, the patient developed pronounced S4, accompanied by mild chest discomfort and worsening of evening leg edema. Resumption of SGLT2i therapy led to a marked reduction in S4 along with a remarkable improvement in chest discomfort and edema within 1\u2009month. These findings were confirmed by visual phonocardiography. This case underscores the potential utility of dynamic S4 changes as a noninvasive indicator of SGLT2i therapy adjustment. These findings highlight the novel clinical application of S4 monitoring in mitigating heart failure progression in patients with T2D."

A retrospective cohort study was performed using electronic health records of Hong Kong. Patients who utilized public healthcare services between the year 1997 and 2021 with complete laboratory records and no cancer history were included. Patients were followed up until December 31, 2021. The associations with each site-specific cancer (colon and rectum, liver, pancreas, bladder, kidney, stomach, and lung) were assessed using Cox regression. A total of 197,906 patients were included. Patients with primarily Type 2 diabetes had a higher risk of developing liver and pancreatic cancers (aHRs for liver: 1.39, 95% CI = 1.11-1.75; pancreas: 2.04, 95% CI = 1.40-2.96) when compared to those without diabetes. Each 1\u2009mmol\/L increase in fasting glucose was associated with a 4% and 8% elevated risk of developing liver and pancreatic cancers, respectively. In general, lower lipids were linked to an increased risk of several malignancies (liver, pancreas, kidney, and stomach). In conclusion, diabetes is associated with an elevated risk of liver and pancreatic cancers. Baseline lipids and liver enzyme could be differentially linked to the risk of cancers at different organ sites by diabetes status."

The present study aimed to assess the preventive effects of <i>Syzygium samarangense<\/i> fruit extract (SSE) on pancreatic \u03b2 cell dysfunction and associated metabolic disturbances in a diabetic rat model. Male Wistar rats were rendered diabetic through a high-fat diet combined with a low dose of streptozotocin and subsequently divided into four groups: Normal control, diabetic control, diabetic treated with SSE (400 mg\/kg) and diabetic treated with glibenclamide (5 mg\/kg), a sulfonylurea insulin secretagogue used as a positive control. Treatments were administered orally for 4 weeks. Biochemical assessments included evaluation of fasting blood glucose, insulin concentrations in both serum and pancreatic tissue, oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde (MDA), activities of key antioxidant enzymes including catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, the hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and liver function enzymes. Administration of SSE resulted in a moderate decrease in blood glucose and a significant increase in insulin levels in both serum and pancreatic tissue. SSE enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes CAT and SOD, while significantly decreasing MDA levels, indicating mitigated oxidative stress. A notable decrease in TNF-\u03b1 was also observed, supporting the anti-inflammatory potential. Furthermore, suppression of PEPCK expression and improved liver enzyme profiles were noted, demonstrating inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and hepatoprotection. Collectively, the present study demonstrates that SSE contributes to improved glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats, primarily by mitigating oxidative stress, inflammation and hepatic dysfunction. These findings support its potential application as a complementary therapy in T2DM."

A frontliner of hPSC-derived tissues used in cell replacement therapies are the pancreatic cells, which have entered multiple clinical trials since 2014 for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Despite challenges in early trials, the detection of endogenous C-peptide in recipients was encouraging. The results and challenges of these trials inspired new areas of research, leading to incremental advances in cell differentiation and delivery technologies, and a deeper understanding of the transplantation microenvironment to enhance therapeutic efficacy and longevity. Reports from the most recent trials demonstrated success in reducing or eliminating exogenous insulin administration for people with T1D, increasing hope for a cure for T1D via regenerative medicine. Recent efforts can be broadly categorized into: (1) improving the cell product as surrogates of native beta cells, (2) promoting engraftment post-transplant to support cell survival, integration into the host, and endocrine function, and (3) developing immunomodulation strategies to reduce or circumvent immunosuppression regimen. In this review, we discuss recent and emerging advances in these three areas and the potential, risk, and scalability of experimental models to the clinic."

        "Abstract":"Non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pose a significant burden on Australia's healthcare system. Despite advancements in disease prevention and management, NCDs remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess trends in the burden of NCDs and the impact of dietary risks in Australia from 2003 to 2024 using data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). Data were from the AIHW 2024 burden of disease dataset, which provided estimates for mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Since the 2024 death counts were missing, total mortality attributable to dietary risks was expressed as the percentage change from 2003 to 2018. Joinpoint Regression was performed to assess DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs of NCDs from 2003 to 2024, analyze the contribution of various dietary risk factors to the disease burden and conduct subgroup comparisons based on sex. From 2003 to 2018, mortality attributed to dietary risks declined by 15.29%. From 2003 to 2024, dietary risks attributable to DALYs decreased by 16.93%. Atrial fibrillation showed the most significant decline in both mortality (-10.0%) and DALYs (-7.81%), driven by a reduction in high-sodium diets. In contrast, inflammatory heart disease experienced the highest increases in DALYs, rising by 18.18% percentage change, which is associated with diet high in sodium. Breast cancer showed the most significant growth driven by diet high in red meat in dietary attributable DALYs, with a percentage change of 6.45%; and in deaths, with a percentage change of 6.67%. T2DM also illustrated a slight increase in dietary attributable DALYs driven by a diet high in red meat, with a percentage change of 2.36%, and in deaths driven by a diet high in processed meat, with a percentage change of 4.10%. In contrast, CKD decreased due to reduction of high sodium in dietary attributable DALYs, with a percentage change of 1.49%, and deaths, with a percentage change of 3.13%. Males showed an increase in risks related to high sodium consumption, with inflammatory heart disease DALYs rising by 15.38%, and a rise in oesophageal cancer deaths linked to low vegetable intake, with a percentage change of 14.49%. Females experienced an increase in T2DM DALYs attributable to high red meat consumption, with a percentage change of 10.26%, and a significant rise in coronary heart disease deaths associated with high sodium intake, with a percentage change of 18.97%. These findings emphasize the ongoing impact of dietary risks on NCDs burden in Australia and underscore the need for sex-specific and targeted dietary interventions to reduce preventable NCDs. Strengthening public health policies, dietary guidelines, and awareness campaigns is crucial for mitigating the impact of poor diet on long-term health outcomes. AIHW is primarily funded by the Australian Government, with additional funding from state and territory governments."

Mean HbA1c prior to providing CGM was 84.10 Mmol\/mol (range 54-132). The mean HbA1c after three months of CGM use was 65.05\u2005Mmol\/mol (range 32-94). Mean reduction in HbA1c was 19.05\u2009\u00b1\u200922.07\u2005mmol\/mol (p\u2009=\u20090.0011) and the greatest improvements were noted in those who had higher HbA1c levels at baseline. Wound size at baseline was 1.53 (0.75-7.62) cm<sup>2<\/sup> and after 3 months it was 0.42 (0.0-1.16) cm<sup>2<\/sup> (p\u2009<\u20090.001); complete wound healing achieved in 3 patients.ConclusionThis study showed a significant improvement in glycaemic control with the use of CGM and had a positive influence on wound healing. The utility of CGM in improving glycaemic control is well established and is currently widely used in type 1 diabetes mellitus and pregnancy but not directly recommended for patients with foot ulcers according to NICE guidelines. Further follow-up and larger-scale studies are needed to validate these findings and to observe the impact on wound healing."

        "Title":"Established and Emerging Roles of Epigenetic Regulation in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.",
        "Abstract":"An increasing number of individuals are at high risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its cardiovascular (CV) complications, which challenges healthcare systems with an increased risk of developing CV diseases. Patients with T2DM exhibit a unique cardiac phenotype termed diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM usually involves complex and multifactorial pathogenic drivers, including myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and early diastolic dysfunction, which potentially evolve into systolic dysfunction and heart failure. There is a lack of effective treatments for DCM on the basis of the complexity of the disease per se and poor understanding of the mechanisms behind disease development and progression. Despite the considerable research attention on the onset of DCM development and progression, understanding of the full spectrum of pathogenic mechanisms has not yet been fully deciphered. Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, bromodomain extra-terminal (BET)-containing reader proteins, and RNA-based mechanisms (e.g., miRs, lncRNAs, circRNA), are significantly associated with the initiation and evolution of DCM, particularly in the early stage. In this review, we provide insights into the evidence of epigenetic alterations related to DCM development and progression characteristics. Furthermore, the uniqueness of epigenetic changes in DCM in specific cell types within diabetic hearts is discussed. We also review epigenetic cooperation in the context of DCM development and epigenetic biomarkers related to DCM progression. With recent advancements in technology, epitranscriptomics-related to DCM has been uniquely discussed. Finally, this review may provide new avenues for potential implications for future research and the discovery of novel treatment targets for preventing the onset and progression of DCM."

        "Abstract":"Existing diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rely solely on glucose thresholds, which are insufficient to capture metabolic heterogeneity. We aimed to evaluate the role of C-peptide measured during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in assisting the development of stratified treatment strategies and predicting the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This nested case-control study conducted within the Xi'an Longitudinal Mother-Child Cohort included 1014 pregnant women with GDM and 1014 without GDM (non-GDM) who delivered singleton live-born infants between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. C-peptide levels were measured at three intervals during the OGTT. Latent class trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct C-peptide trajectories, and logistic regression was used to assess their associations with adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. Two principal C-peptide trajectories were identified in GDM despite similar glucose profiles. GDM Class 1 (771, 76.04%) presented a delayed 120-min C-peptide peak and poorer beta-cell secretion, whereas GDM Class 2 (243, 23.96%) presented a sharp 60-min peak followed by a decline and significantly increased insulin resistance, with greater risks of delivering large for gestational age (LGA) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-2.15) and macrosomia (aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.13-2.97). Surprisingly, 21.7% (220) of the non-GDM group had a high C-peptide response associated with elevated preeclampsia risk (aOR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.25-6.74). Dynamic OGTT-derived C-peptide trajectories revealed clinically significant metabolic subgroups of GDM that were obscured by glucose-only diagnostics, with the predominantly insulin-resistant Class being at higher risk of fetal overgrowth."

We extracted data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES1999-2016),and 7000 patients with diabetes were eligible. Weighted logistic regression and weighted restricted cubic spline analyses were performed to explore the association between WC, WWI, WHtR, WTH.5R and the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were further conducted. The WHtR index demonstrated a statistically significant positive linear relationship with the likelihoodof CVD [Quartile 4, full adjusted: OR 1.84(1.38,2.47)], CHF [Quartile 4, full adjusted: OR 2.35(1.51,3.66)], CAD [Quartile 4, full adjusted: OR 1.43(1.06,1.94)] and stroke [Quartile 4, full adjusted: OR 1.59(1.01,2.51)]. Moreover, the WC and WHT.5R were positively associated withCVD [Quartile 4, full adjusted: WC OR 1.95(2.44,2.65); WHT.5R OR 2.01(1.53,2.63)], CHF [Quartile 4, full adjusted: WC OR 2.83(1.79,4.47); WHT.5R OR 2.33(1.52,3.58)], and CAD [Quartile 4, full adjusted: WC OR 1.64(1.22,2.21); WHT.5R OR 1.43(1.06,1.94)], while WWI exhibited a similar association with the prevalence ratesof CVD [Quartile 4, full adjusted: OR 1.76(1.29,2.42)] and CAD [Quartile 4, full adjusted: OR 1.51(1.04,2.19)]. RCS analyses showed that all indices had a linear relationship with the probability of CVD, CHF, CAD, and stroke.

        "Abstract":"A higher risk of cardiovascular disease has been correlated with several inflammatory biomarkers, one of which is the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII). Nevertheless, the relationship between SII and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients with diabetes and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic value of SII for the risk of MACCE in patients with diabetes and ACS who underwent PCI. This study included 1782 patients with ACS and diabetes who underwent PCI successfully at Beijing Anzhen Hospital between August 2021 and April 2022, with a median follow-up of 16.2 months. According to the optimal SII cut-off value for MACCE, patients were categorized into two groups: the high SII group (SII\u2009\u2265\u2009735.82\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>9<\/sup>\/L, n\u2009=\u2009576) and the low SII group (SII\u2009<\u2009735.82\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>9<\/sup>\/L, n\u2009=\u20091206). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to verify the relationship between SII and MACCE, and the reliability of the relationship was further tested by subgroup analysis. The incidence of MACCE was significantly higher in the high SII group than in the low SII group (11.3% vs. 6.7%, log-rank P\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating that among 22 patients with high SII levels, an additional MACCE event is expected to occur. Univariate Cox proportional hazards models showed that higher SII was associated with an increased incidence of MACCE (HR: 1.739, 95%CI: 1.254-2.410). After full adjustment, higher SII remained an independent risk factor for MACCE (HR: 1.540, 95%CI: 1.098-2.160) and unplanned revascularization (HR: 1.526, 95%CI: 1.011-2.301). This study found that elevated SII is an independent risk factor for predicting MACCE in patients with ACS and diabetes mellitus after PCI, providing a theoretical basis for postoperative anti-inflammatory therapy in this population."

        "Abstract":"The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) is a novel lipid parameter calculated as the logarithmic ratio of triglycerides (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Initially proposed as a marker for predicting cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerosis, AIP has more recently been found to be closely associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and the development of type 2 diabetes(T2DM). However, its role in women with a history of GDM, a unique high-risk population, remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the AIP and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prevalence in women with a history of GDM. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 4,690 parous women from the 2007-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), with participants stratified by GDM history. Multivariate logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the association between the AIP and T2DM among women with a history of GDM. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed within the GDM group to explore effect modification. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were used to assess the linearity of the association between the AIP and T2DM prevalence. Mediation analysis was also conducted to examine whether the AIP score mediated the relationship between GDM history and T2DM. Among women with a history of GDM, higher AIP values were significantly associated with increased T2DM prevalence. A dose-response relationship was observed across AIP quartiles, with women in the highest quartile showing a markedly elevated risk (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20095.01, 95% CI: 1.89, 13.25, p\u2009<\u20090.01). RCS analysis revealed a linear association between AIP and T2DM in this population. Mediation analysis further revealed that the AIP partially mediated the association between GDM and T2DM, accounting for 8.0% of the total effect (95% CI: 5.1-12.5%). AIP is associated with T2DM prevalence in women with a history of GDM. These findings indicate that the AIP may serve as a potential early indicator for identifying individuals at elevated risk of progressing from GDM to T2DM."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the major cause of vision decline in adults worldwide. Photoreceptor loss is considered a main pathogenesis of retinal dysfunction in DR. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) treatment has been considered a promising cell-free approach for retinal disorders. However, the role and mechanism of MEVs in alleviating photoreceptor injury in DR remain unclear. In this study, MEV treatment improved retinal function and inhibited photoreceptor apoptosis in db\/db mice. Mechanistically, the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific peptidase 25 (USP25) in MEVs was responsible for the MEV-mediated photoreceptor therapy by inhibiting hyperglycemia-induced \u03b1A-crystallin (CRYAA) ubiquitination. Moreover, USP25-enriched MEVs modified with the photoreceptor-targeting peptide MH42 (MEVs<sup>MH42<\/sup>-USP25) were prepared by genetic engineering and surface conjugation. MEVs<sup>MH42<\/sup>-USP25 exhibited elevated repairing efficiency to attenuate retinal dysfunction and photoreceptor loss in db\/db mice. Our study develops an MEV-based nanocarrier for photoreceptor-targeted delivery and highlights the effectiveness of MEVs<sup>MH42<\/sup>-USP25 as novel therapeutics for DR."

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 20,310 unselected patients with CKD enrolled from 2006 to 2015. The relationship between the TG\/HDL-C ratio and the likelihood of DM was evaluated using binary logistic regression. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed, and a generalized additive model with smooth curve fitting assessed potential non-linear associations. We also performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis to assess the determination and clinical use, respectively. Among the participants (mean age 60.907\u2009\u00b1\u200910.044 years; 79.580% male), 1,758 (8.656%) had DM. The median TG\/HDL-C ratio was 0.655(interquartile range 0.465-0.920). After adjusting for covariates, a significant positive association was found between the TG\/HDL-C ratio and DM likelihood (odds ratio [OR], 1.494; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.354-1.648; P\u2009<\u20090.001). A non-linear relationship was observed with an inflection point at a TG\/HDL-C ratio of 1.030. The ORs below and above this point were 1.866 (95% CI, 1.472-2.365) and 1.297 (95% CI, 1.094-1.538), respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of the nomogram was of 0.580 (95% CI, 0.566-0.594). Subgroup analyses indicated a stronger association in patients without hypertension, in female and patients with AF. The TG\/HDL-C ratio is independently associated with DM likelihood in patients with CKD, exhibiting a non-linear relationship particularly significant when the ratio is below 1.030. The TG\/HDL-C ratio may serve as a useful marker for DM likelihood assessment in CKD patients, though prospective studies are needed to determine its role in prevention strategies. Not applicable."

        "Abstract":"Eye diseases can affect vision and well-being, so early, accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent serious impairment. Deep learning models have shown promise for automating the diagnosis of eye diseases from images. However, current methods mostly use single-model architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which might not adequately capture the long-range spatial correlations and local fine-grained features required for classification. To address these limitations, this study proposes a multi-stage framework for eye diseases (MST-EDS), including two stages: hybrid and stacking models in the categorization of eye illnesses across four classes: normal, diabetic_retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract, utilizing a benchmark dataset from Kaggle. Hybrid models are developed based on Transformer models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and Swin Transformer are used to extract deep features from images, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the complexity of extracted features, and Machine Learning (ML) models are used as classifiers to enhance performance. In the stacking model, the outputs of the best hybrid models are stacked, and they are used to train and evaluate meta-learners to improve classification performance. The experimental results show that the MST-EDS-RF model recorded the best performance compared to individual Transformer and hybrid models, with 97.163% accuracy."

This study aims to develop and validate a predictive nomogram for carotid atherosclerosis specifically in patients with type 2 diabetes, addressing the lack of effective risk-stratification tools. A retrospective cohort study involving 1,258 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. The 880 diabetic patients diagnosed between 2018 and 2021 were divided into a training set (n\u2009=\u2009616) and an internal validation set (n\u2009=\u2009264) at a 7:3 ratio. An additional 378 patients from 2022 to 2023 were included as an external validation set. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected. Risk factors were identified using LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression, leading to the development of a nomogram. Model performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. The nomogram identified age, smoking, drinking, systolic blood pressure, lipoprotein(a), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and creatinine as independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. The model demonstrated good discrimination, with area under the curve values of 0.791, 0.725, and 0.721 for the training, internal, and external validation sets, respectively. Calibration curves indicated a strong alignment between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes. Decision curve analysis confirmed the model's clinical utility, especially when the threshold probability was above 15%.

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with impaired host immune responses, increasing the risk for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI). This study investigated how DM and associated metabolic dysfunction alter Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific cytokine and chemokine responses. We analysed a cohort of 164 participants with and without DM and\/or LTBI. Mtb-specific cytokine\/chemokine responses were measured in QuantiFERON-TB Gold-Plus supernatants using a 17-plex Luminex assay to quantify Th1, Th2, Th17, inflammatory and regulatory responses. DM was associated with decreased Mtb-specific IFN-\u03b3, TNF, IL-12, IP-10 and MIP-1\u03b1, with increased IFN-\u03b1 compared to non-DM, suggesting impairment of Th1 and inflammatory pathways. Additionally, pre-DM was not associated with altered cytokine\/chemokine responses, but subtle changes in IL-10, GM-CSF, MIP-1\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 may suggest early indicators of immune dysregulation. Poorly controlled DM was associated with increased IL-4 and IFN-\u03b1, indicating a shift toward Th2 and inflammatory responses. Compared to borderline high, high total cholesterol levels, indicating dyslipidaemia, were associated with decreased IFN-\u03b3, TNF and IL-2, suggesting impaired Th1 immunity. These findings imply that metabolic disturbances may compromise Mtb-specific immune responses, potentially increasing TB infection susceptibility. Optimising glycaemic and lipid control may be crucial for restoring immune balance and improving TB outcomes in patients with DM-associated metabolic dysfunction."

Current non-invasive methods, such as urinalysis (including colorimetry and biosensors), are primarily laboratory-based and lack user-friendliness, limiting their practicality for continuous glucose monitoring. Although promising, research on smartphone-integrated laser refractometry for glucose detection remains limited. To address this gap, a non-contact, smartphone-based laser refractometer for glucose monitoring was developed. This prototype measures the refractive index of urine by analyzing the refracted length of a laser line, which correlates with fasting blood glucose concentrations. The system uses a smartphone to capture high-resolution images of the laser line generated by total internal reflection through a rod and refraction through the urine sample. Assessments were conducted using controlled glucose concentrations, varying turbidity levels, different samples volume, and shelf-life conditions. Volumetric and shelf-life variations showed no significant impact on results, whereas turbidity assessments revealed a limitation of up to 57 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). Fasting glucose levels measured from using the developed system were compared with laboratory fasting blood glucose results, yielding a correlation coefficients of 0.89 and a sensitivity of 4.8\u00a0mg\/dL. The system is low-cost, making it accessible and suitable for telemedicine applications, offering remote glucose monitoring for patients. This approach paves the way for clinically relevant glucose detection in diabetic patients without the need for invasive finger-prick blood sampling."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to insulin deficiency or resistance. While conventional treatments are effective, integrating nutraceuticals that aid in blood sugar control is crucial for patients with low compliance or prediabetes. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of kefir-derived exopolysaccharides (KEPS) in ameliorating type 2 DM in rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and a high-fat diet. Eight-week-old male SD rats were fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks and subsequently administered STZ (35\u2009mg\/kg body weight) via intraperitoneal injection to induce type 2 diabetes. Diabetic rats were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated diabetes (mock), diabetic rats + high-dose KEPS (STZ-KEPSH), and diabetic rats + low-dose KEPS (STZ-KEPSL), and treated for an additional 4 weeks. An age-matched SD rat group without STZ induction was used as a control. Our findings demonstrate that high-dose KEPS administration in diabetic rats enhances hepatic glucose uptake and stabilizes blood glucose levels by upregulating GLUT2 protein expression and PI3k phosphorylation in liver cells. KEPS mitigates lipid production, reduces \u03b2 cell damage, and preserves islet cell integrity, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and alleviating diabetes symptoms. High-dose KEPS treatment also exhibits less renal enlargement and lower kidney-to-body weight ratio than the diabetic group. Exopolysaccharides derived from kefir show promising potential in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats, suggesting a viable nutraceutical therapy. Further research is needed to validate these findings in human subjects."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with a range of serious complications, including insulin resistance (IR) and cognitive impairments. IR is recognized as a high-risk factor for the development of cognitive decline. However, it remains unclear which endogenous or exogenous factors induce these two pathological features. Recent studies indicate that certain diets, environmental pollutants, and genetic deficiencies or polymorphisms influence the metabolism of endogenous formaldehyde. Formaldehyde has been implicated in the onset of DM. Notably, elevated levels of formaldehyde have been detected in the blood, peripheral organs (such as the spleen and liver), and brains of both DM patients and animal models of diabetes. Formaldehyde-induced hyperglycemia and high glucose levels generate formaldehyde, creating a vicious cycle that speeds up diabetic complications. Further, excessive formaldehyde induces IR through three distinct mechanisms: alteration of the biologically active conformation of insulin, reduction in insulin receptor expression, and modification of insulin receptor structure. In addition, excessive formaldehyde can impair cognitive functions by inhibiting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and exacerbating brain IR. In this review, we discuss the pivotal role of diet-derived formaldehyde in diabetes and propose that reduction of formaldehyde by the formaldehyde scavengers may be a new strategy for treating DM patients."

The clinical data of 68 patients with Wagner grade 3-4 type 2 diabetic foot ulcers treated with TTT between May 2022 and September 2023 was retrospectively analyzed. The cohort included 49 males and 19 females, aged 44-91 years (mean, 67.3 years), with 40 Wagner grade 3 and 28 grade 4 ulcers. The duration of type 2 diabetes ranged from 5 to 23 years, with an average of 10 years. The number of wound healing cases, healing time, amputation cases, death cases, and complications were observed and recorded. Serum samples were collected at 6 key time points [1 day before TTT and 3 days, 7 days (the first day of upward transverse transfer), 14 days (the first day of downward transverse transfer), 21 days (the first day after the end of transfer), 36 days (the first day after the removal of the transfer device)], and the serum immunoglobulin levels were detected by flow cytometry including immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, IgE, complement C3 (C3), C4, immunoglobulin light chain \u03ba (KAP), immunoglobulin light chain \u03bb (LAM). All the 68 patients were followed up 6 months. Postoperative pin tract infection occurred in 3 cases and incision infection in 2 cases. Amputation occurred in 5 patients (7.4%) at 59-103 days after operation, and 8 patients (11.8%) died at 49-77 days after operation; the wounds of the remaining 55 patients (80.9%) healed in 48-135 days, with an average of 80 days. There was no recurrence of ulcer, peri-osteotomy fracture, or local skin necrosis during follow-up. The serum immunoglobulin levels of 55 patients with wound healing showed that the levels of IgG and IgM decreased significantly on the 3rd and 7th day after operation compared with those before operation ( <i>P<\/i><0.05), and gradually returned to the levels before operation after 14 days, and reached the peak on the 36th day. IgA levels continued to decrease with time, and there were significant differences at all time points when compared with those before operation ( <i>P<\/i><0.05). The level of IgE significantly decreased at 21 days after operation compared with that before operation ( <i>P<\/i><0.05), while it was higher at other time points than that before operation, but the difference was not significant ( <i>P<\/i>>0.05). The level of C3 showed a clear treatment-related increase, which was significantly higher on the 7th, 14th, and 21st days after operation than that before operation ( <i>P<\/i><0.05), and the peak appeared on the 14th day. The change trend of C4 level was basically synchronous with that of C3, but the amplitude was smaller, and the difference was significant at 7 and 14 days after operation compared with that before operation ( <i>P<\/i><0.05). There was no significant difference in KAP\/LAM between different time points before and after operation ( <i>P<\/i>>0.05). TTT can accelerate wound healing, effectively treat diabetic foot ulcer, and reduce amputation rate, and has definite effectiveness. The potential mechanisms of TTT in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers include the dynamic regulation of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels to balance the process of inflammation and repair, and the periodic increase of C3 and C4 levels may promote tissue cleaning, angiogenesis, and anti-infection defense."

The procedure for the treatment of diabetic foot has evolved from an open large cortical window (120 mm\u00d720 mm) to a minimally invasive small window (50 mm\u00d715 mm), with incision length reduced to 10 mm and simplified external fixators. A dual-incision technique (10 mm apart) is now applied at 5 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity. Bone transport typically begins 3-5 days postoperatively at a rate of 1 mm\/day, incorporating the \"accordion technique\" (2 weeks distraction+3 days stabilization+reverse transport). Multicenter studies report a limb salvage rate of 96.1%, wound healing rate of 96.3%, and amputation rate of less than 5%. Combining TTT with vascular reconstruction and antibiotic-loaded bone cement further enhances outcomes. There are also a series of studies on the mechanism of TTT in treating diabetic foot. TTT has been shown to activate the hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1-vascular endothelial growth factor\/stromal cell-derived factor 1 (HIF-1\u03b1-VEGF\/SDF-1) signaling pathway to facilitate microcirculatory reconstruction; mobilize immune cells and rebalance macrophage polarization, thereby improving the inflammatory microenvironment; recruit stem cells via chemotaxis to accelerate re-epithelialization; and promote the release of regenerative small extracellular vesicles. TTT demonstrates promising clinical potential in the treatment of diabetic foot, particularly in improving limb perfusion and promoting tissue repair. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Further in-depth investigations are required. In addition, the current lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials highlights the urgent need for rigorously designed randomized controlled trial to validate the efficacy and safety of this technique."

        "Abstract":"Quality improvement efforts have aimed to improve annual diabetic retinopathy screening at our institution, but rates remain well below goal. To better understand facilitators, barriers and operational issues unique to our health system and to develop a comprehensive understanding of the care pathway, the Patient Voice toolkit was applied. In-depth interviews were conducted individually with patients and care team members in a large urban academic medical centre with multiple satellite community clinics. Interviews with patients focused on facilitators and barriers to annual diabetic retinopathy screening. These interviews were transcribed and organised into discrete codes to identify initial themes. We interviewed clinic staff involved in diabetic retinopathy examination scheduling, execution or quality assurance. Interviews with care team members focused on training materials, camera operations and workflow. Through analysis of 15 patient interviews, we found that facilitators included internal motivation, automated examination reminders, reminders from providers and utilisation of local optometry offices. Barriers included competing demands, distant retinal camera locations, limited appointment access and financial and insurance issues. Interviews with 13 care team members resulted in the creation of a process map, and areas of opportunity were identified in the training and operational workflows. The inclusion of different stakeholder perspectives provides in-depth insight into facilitators and barriers to completing annual diabetic retinopathy screening, allowing for recommendations tailored to our specific health system and operations. Suggested operational improvements include expanding clinics that can perform this examination, increasing appointment flexibility, partnering with local optometry clinics and enhancing annual examination reminders to include more details about the examination. Recommendations suggested by staff include increasing patient education, setting expectations around the examination and implementing real-time feedback on image quality."

Retrospective study. Ophthalmology Centre of General Hospital. 127 participants enrolled: 33 healthy participants, 57 diabetic patients with DPN (DPN+) and 37 diabetic patients without DPN (DPN-). Not applicable. The CCM image dataset, which was collected from participants (with five images per eye), was randomly divided into training, validation and test subsets in a 7:1:2 ratio. The images were preprocessed, augmented and used to train the InceptionV3 model. We compared its performance against the ResNet, DenseNet and Swin Transformer models. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, recall, F1 score and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. For single-participant predictions, the InceptionV3 model achieved the highest accuracy (0.9231), recall (0.8846), F1 score (0.9020) and AUC (0.9534) compared with the other models. For single-image predictions in the three-class classification task of CCM images, the InceptionV3 model achieved a precision of 0.8385, a recall of 0.9083, an F1 score of 0.8720 and an AUC of 0.8769 for predicting DPN+. The InceptionV3-based DLA model achieved superior performance compared with traditional convolutional neural network architectures like ResNet and DenseNet, and the Swin transformer model, highlighting its potential for effective DPN screening."

        "Abstract":"In this study, acylated starch from Canna edulis starch was syntheized by reacting it with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and investigated its fermentation properties using fecal samples from healthy individuals and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in vitro. Additionally, the correlation was analyzed between intestinal flora and T2DM indicators through in-vivo animal experiments. The in-vitro fermentation results showed that, compared to controls, Canna edulis butyrylated starch (PSB) increased butyric acid concentration by 6.08-fold while Canna edulis valeroylated starch (PSV) increased valeric acid concentration by 9.30-fold in T2DM patients. Notably, PSB and PSV markedly increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus. Animal studies have shown that acylated starch intervention significantly improved T2DM metrics of weight reduction, blood glucose, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and intestinal flora disruption. Both starch types promoted the enrichment of SCFA-producing flora; PSB primarily increased butyric and isobutyric acid levels while PSV primarily increased acetic, propionic, and valeric acid levels. This study further found that PSB and PSV significantly reduced the relative abundance of harmful flora Desulfovibrio, Ligilactobacillus, and Limosilactobacillus, while PSB favored the enrichment of Bifidobacterium, Butyricimonas, and Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and PSV promoted Akkermansia, Blautia, and Parabacteroides. These findings indicate that PSB and PSV may exert hypoglycemic effects in T2DM through distinct microbial and metabolic pathways."

        "Abstract":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or the dry eye disease (DED) is prevalent multifactorial disorder of the tears and ocular surface, which has lately been interested scholars, particularly in establishing its link with diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to evaluate the association between DM and DED through a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing published articles, and thus understand the attributed risks for DED development in diabetic patients. Four databases, PubMed, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and Google Scholar, were electronically searched for relevant publications. Peer-reviewed articles in English language reporting on DED prevalence among diabetic population published over the last 10\u00a0years were considered. A random effect model with odds ratio (OR) and risk ratio (RR) and respective confidence intervals were used in our statistical analysis to determine pooled effect sizes. This study included 23 studies with 5566 participants. Diabetic individuals had a significantly higher prevalence of dry eye disease (DED) than non-diabetics (OR: 2.30 [95\u00a0% CI: 1.54-3.43]; RR: 1.69 [95\u00a0% CI: 1.28-2.25]). Older age (>50\u00a0years), longer diabetes duration (>10\u00a0years), and poor glycemic control (HbA1c >7\u00a0%) were associated with increased DED risk. Gender-based findings varied, with slightly higher odds in males, though not statistically significant. High heterogeneity (I<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a072\u00a0%) was observed, but sensitivity analyses confirmed result stability. Minimal publication bias was detected. Mechanisms linking diabetes to DED included oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuropathy-related tear dysfunction. Our study confirmed a significant association between DM and DED prevalence and severity, and diabetic patients exhibit higher DED risks. These risks are pronounced in older adults, particularly those diagnosed with T2DM.\". Hence, early detection and management of DED in diabetic population is a priority to enhance patient's quality of life."

        "Abstract":"Glycaemic variability (GV) may reflect sharp rises and acute fluctuations in blood glucose, which are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of GV on 28-day outcome in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) with or without diabetes mellitus (DM). This retrospective cohort study adhered to the RECORD (REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Data) guidelines. We used clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. GV was assessed using the coefficient of variation of blood glucose levels and statistically analysed by dividing patients into three groups according to GV tertiles (GV1, GV2 and GV3), with a primary outcome of 28-day prognosis and secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation status, length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay. A total of 1091 patients from the MIMIC-IV database with CS were included, of which a total of 409 (37.49\u00a0%) were male patients and 682 (62.51\u00a0%) were female patients. Based on GV levels, three groups were classified as GV1 (<16.2\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a0318), GV2 (16.2\u00a0%-25.3\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a0388), and GV3 (>25.3\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a0385). According to the Kaplan-Meier curves, the 28-day prognosis was significantly better in GV1 patients than in GV3 [220 (69.2\u00a0%) vs. 234 (60.8\u00a0%), P\u00a0=\u00a00.044], and the same was true in the Non-DM subgroup [188 (73.7\u00a0%) vs. 108 (61.4\u00a0%), P\u00a0=\u00a00.016]. In a multifactorial COX analysis, GV was significantly associated with the risk of 28-day mortality in patients [HR 1.42, 95\u00a0% CI 1.10-1.60, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012]. In the subgroup analyses, the risk of death was highest in the DM subgroup of patients with GV3 (HR: 1.53, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). GV significantly increases the 28-day risk of death in patients with CS, especially in DM patients. Future optimisation of glucose monitoring techniques and exploration of GV modulation strategies are needed to improve patient prognosis. What is known about this research topic: Glycaemic variability (GV) significantly increases the 28-day risk of death in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). GV level (16.2\u00a0%-25.3\u00a0%) was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in patients with DM and CS, and GV (>25.3\u00a0%) was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in Non-DM patients with CS. What this study adds and its future implications: More optimal glucose monitoring techniques and GV modulation strategies need to be refined to improve patient outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic immune-mediated disease that leads to the loss of beta cells in the pancreas, clinically characterized by polydipsia, polyphagia, and weight loss. The disease is most prevalent in the first and second decades of life, with a consistent annual increase. The dependence on insulin therapy indefinitely is well known. Although advances in this area, such as new continuous glucose monitoring devices with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, have improved patient quality of life, they do not affect disease pathogenesis and do not consistently reduce long-term complications. In addition to requiring lifestyle sacrifices and, in many cases, failing to meet therapeutic target points, it increases the risk of hypoglycemia, an acute and potentially fatal complication. Following decades of research and advances in therapeutic technologies, approaches have been developed based on diverse mechanisms in the disease's pathogenesis. This review focuses on new immunotherapy approaches for type 1 diabetes, including cell-targeted therapies, cytokines, and cell transplants to preserve beta-cell function."

This study explores inequalities in glycaemic monitoring and testing in Milan (Northern Italy) using glycated haemoglobin data. Analysing administrative data from 56,795 T2DM patients aged 40 to 85, we assess the interplay of education, gender, and ethnicity in diabetes care. Findings show that all three dimensions impact T2DM care. A clear socioeconomic gradient exists among Italians. Males have higher testing rates and lower blood glucose levels than females, but inequalities are similar. Ethnic disparities are pronounced, with foreign-born individuals facing worse outcomes than Italians. Trends vary across groups, highlighting significant gender differences and sometimes reversed social gradients. These results underscore the need for targeted interventions to address structural inequalities in diabetes care and reduce health disparities. Integrating biomarkers into social epidemiology provides a framework for understanding how social determinants translate into biological outcomes, thereby guiding equitable healthcare policies."

We investigated the association between circulating biomarkers, reflecting residual risk, with incident CHD in a general population, according to the presence of five CVRFs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and obesity) at baseline. Overall 212,598 CHD-free individuals from 21 European population-based cohorts were stratified by CVRF burden into three groups, having zero (n\u00a0=\u00a035,707), one (n\u00a0=\u00a068,548) or \u22652 (n\u00a0=\u00a0108,343) risk factors at baseline. Five biomarkers (triglycerides (TGs), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), cystatin C, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin I) were assessed in a subset with available measurements. During a median follow-up of 13.97 years, 17,499 participants developed incident CHD with 453 events occurring among individuals without CVRFs. Although increased concentrations of all biomarkers were related to incident CHD, significant risk modulation by CVRFs was seen only for TGs and, to a lesser extent, for hsCRP. The fully-adjusted sub-distribution Hazard Ratios (95\u00a0% CI) were for TGs (\u2265vs\u00a0<\u00a01.70\u00a0mmol\/L) 1.66 (1.29-2.15) in those without CVRFs versus 1.35 (1.21-1.49)\/1.14 (1.07-1.20) in those with 1 or \u22652 risk factors (p<sub>interaction<\/sub><0.01) and for hsCRP (\u2265vs\u00a0<\u00a02\u00a0mg\/L) 1.39 (1.02-1.90) versus 1.42 (1.26-1.61) or 1.22 (1.13-1.32), respectively (p<sub>interaction<\/sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.092). Even in the absence of CVRFs, elevated triglycerides and hsCRP were significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD. These results highlight the importance of residual risk assessment using those biomarkers in individuals deemed metabolically healthy by conventional standards."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is both a metabolic and chronic inflammatory disease, wherein immune dysregulation contributes to multisystem complications. Beyond glycemic control, anti-diabetic agents-Metformin (Met), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs)-exert immunomodulatory effects through cytokine and chemokine modulation. This review summarizes mechanistic and experimental findings (2013-2025), showing that Met suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 beta [IL-1\u03b2], IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1]) and enhances anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-10, growth differentiation factor-15 [GDF-15]) via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) inhibition, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome suppression, and gut microbiota modulation. These effects reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in organs including the kidney, liver, brain, and retina. SGLT-2i (e.g., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) reduce IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), primarily in renal, cardiac, and hepatic tissues, through \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate-induced NLRP3 inhibition and mitochondrial protection. Empagliflozin also suppresses Th17 and promotes Treg responses in T2D. GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide, semaglutide) reduce IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1, enhance IL-10 and stromal-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1), and decrease MCP-1, improving endothelial function and wound healing. These agents modulate TGF-\u03b2\/small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) and AMPK pathways to attenuate fibrosis, oxidative injury, and neuronal damage. Emerging novel formulations and synergistic combinations further amplify their anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits. This dual immunometabolic action repositions anti-diabetic agents as multifunctional modulators in precision therapy, extending their role beyond glycemic control to the long-term prevention of complications."

        "Abstract":"Platelet hyperreactivity increases the risk of cardiovascular thrombosis in diabetes and failure of antiplatelet drug therapies. Elevated basal and agonist-induced calcium flux is a fundamental cause of platelet hyperreactivity in diabetes; however, the mechanisms responsible for this remain largely unknown. Using a high-sensitivity, unbiased proteomic platform, we consistently detected over 2,400 intracellular proteins and identified proteins that were differentially released by platelets in type 2 diabetes. We identified that SEC61 translocon subunit \u03b2 (SEC61B) was increased in platelets from humans and mice with hyperglycemia and in megakaryocytes from mice with hyperglycemia. SEC61 is known to act as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium leak channel in nucleated cells. Using HEK293 cells, we showed that SEC61B overexpression increased calcium flux into the cytosol and decreased protein synthesis. Concordantly, platelets in hyperglycemic mice mobilized more calcium and had decreased protein synthesis. Platelets in both humans and mice with hyperglycemia had increased ER stress. ER stress induced the expression of platelet SEC61B and increased cytosolic calcium. Inhibition of SEC61 with anisomycin decreased platelet calcium flux and inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo. These studies demonstrate the existence of a mechanism whereby ER stress-induced upregulation of platelet SEC61B leads to increased cytosolic calcium, potentially contributing to platelet hyperreactivity in diabetes."

        "Abstract":"The global rise in the prevalence of diabetes significantly impacts the quality of life of both patients and their families. Despite advances in diabetes care, numerous challenges remain in its management. In recent years, digital tools have been increasingly integrated into diabetes care, demonstrating some positive outcomes. However, the long-term effectiveness and associated challenges of these tools in diabetes management remain areas for future research. This study aims to assess the types and current usage of digital tools in diabetes management, analyze their benefits and limitations, and provide recommendations for optimizing their future application in diabetes care. This scoping review followed the 5-stage framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 9 electronic databases (CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP, Sinomed, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) from their inception to July 31, 2024. Study selection was independently performed by 2 reviewers, descriptive analysis was conducted, and findings were presented narratively, key study characteristics-including first author, publication date, country or region, study type, sample size, type of digital tools, intervention methods, intervention duration, limitations, and outcome indicators-were independently extracted and cross-checked by 2 investigators. A total of 6263 articles were initially retrieved. After deduplication and a 2-stage screening process (initial screening based on titles and abstracts followed by full-text assessment), 45 studies meeting the predefined inclusion criteria were ultimately included for analysis, originating from 7 countries. The included studies demonstrated marked heterogeneity in research designs: randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n=26, 57.8%), non-RCTs (n=15, 33.3%), quasi-RCTs (n=1, 2.2%), observational studies (n=1, 2.2%), mixed-methods studies (n=1, 2.2%), and qualitative studies (n=1, 2.2%). The digital tools primarily included mobile health apps, integrated management information platforms, Diabetes Online Community (DOC), specialized monitoring and analytics tools, blood glucose information management systems, and remote monitoring and follow-up systems, among others. These tools were applied across home, hospital, and community settings. Outcome measures were primarily focused on evaluating glycemic control efficacy (eg, fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin), blood lipid levels, BMI, self-management capacity, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and diabetes knowledge. This review highlights the diversity and potential value of digital tools in diabetes care, particularly in supporting patient self-management and extending care across multiple settings. From a nursing perspective, digital interventions offer opportunities for individualized care, patient engagement, and continuity of services. However, challenges such as technology acceptance remain. Future studies should address gaps related to long-term effectiveness, economic evaluation, and tool adaptation for aging populations, while incorporating interdisciplinary approaches and real-world evidence to inform sustainable digital health strategies."

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), initially indicated for diabetes, show promise in weight loss but face coverage issues, high costs, and premature prescribing from physicians. Research is needed to assess prescribing patterns, especially in patients without diabetes. We conducted a retrospective, population-based, observational study using the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database and the Merative MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Database, which capture person-specific clinical utilization and expenditures. We analyzed GLP-1 RA prescribing rates from 2018 to 2023, comparing semaglutide with other GLP-1 RAs and stratifying by diabetes and overweight\/obesity indications. The study included individuals 18 years or older with 12 months of continuous enrollment from 2018 to 2023, categorizing GLP-1 RA users into 4 groups based on diabetes and obesity\/overweight diagnosis codes within a year of their index date. Prescribing of GLP-1 RA medications, particularly semaglutides, increased notably over the years, whereas dulaglutide, liraglutide, and exenatide use declined. When investigating possible premature prescribing by examining users with no diabetes indication, the number of prediabetes or abnormal glucose diagnoses increased slightly before the index GLP-1 RA prescribing index date. However, less than 9% received a diabetes or prediabetes diagnosis 30 days after starting a GLP-1 RA. From 2018 to 2023, GLP-1 RA prescribing increased significantly, with semaglutide approved for weight loss rising to 60% share in the nondiabetic obese\/overweight group. Trends showed a notable rise in prescriptions for nondiabetic and obese\/overweight patients."

Retrospective time series from a national insurance database, with members in all US states, including data from 2008 to 2021. Insulin OOP costs and 30-day equivalent fills per year were quantified among insulin users aged 12 to 64 years, stratified by income (low- vs high-poverty zip code) and health plan type (high-deductible health plans with savings options [HDHP\/SO] vs not). Participants were commercially insured insulin users aged 12 to 64 years with at least 1 full enrollment year. Characteristics of interest for disparities analysis included income level (low- vs high-poverty zip code) and health plan type (HDHP\/SO vs non-HDHP\/SO plan). After increases in adjusted mean annual insulin OOP costs from 2008 ($221 per non-HDHP\/SO member and $313 per HDHP\/SO member) to 2014 ($280 and $496, respectively), HDHP\/SO members had persistent relative reductions in insulin use. In 2014, HDHP\/SO members had 0.17 fewer annual fills, a disparity that increased until 2019 (0.79) before decreasing slightly by 2021 (-0.55). Lower-income members consistently had fewer insulin fills. Insulin OOP cost reduction policies would be more efficient if they targeted HDHP\/SO plan members and low-income patients."

Development and documentation of self-management goals for chronic diseases within the electronic medical record (EMR) is a PCMH accreditation standard through the Joint Commission. This quality improvement project aimed to implement a structured approach to creating and documenting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) goals for patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in a military-affiliated Internal Medicine clinic. Although SMART goals have demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), the effects of SMART goals on patient perceptions of their health and self-management of their DM have not been fully studied. This study voluntarily enrolled 62 patients aged 19-90 with DM and HbA1c >8% (64 mmol\/mol) within the previous 6-month period from a military-affiliated Internal Medicine clinic. Exclusion criteria included patients following with a subspecialist for DM management. Enrolled patients developed and discussed SMART goals with their physician using a standardized goal-setting tool for self-management of their DM. These goals were documented in the EMR for longitudinal follow-up between patients, physicians, and the clinic care team. HbA1c and patient self-reported health perceptions were evaluated before and after 3 months of participation in this intervention. Data analysis used a 2-tailed paired samples t-test. The study protocol underwent Institutional Review Board examination and was determined not to constitute research. Of 62 patients enrolled, 36 completed post-surveys and were included in the statistical analysis. Results showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels, with a mean decrease from 9.18% (77.2 mmol\/mol) to 7.84% (62.7 mmol\/mol) (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Patient-reported perceptions of their health, goal-oriented behaviors, perceived ability to influence health through lifestyle changes, and responsibility for self-management of their DM did not change significantly. This quality improvement project further highlights the importance of self-management goals in improving biomedical outcomes and disease management markers. Despite a significant improvement in HbA1c, no changes were observed in patient-reported health perceptions. Overall, patients indicated high adherence and positive feedback with this intervention. The goal-setting tool and standardized documentation strategy as implemented are a viable strategy for satisfying a PCMH accreditation standard. Future studies could address limitations such as single-site design, response rates, and review specific effects on perceptions with the use of validated survey instruments. Similar self-management interventions can be applied to other chronic diseases where daily lifestyle choices influence outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Glucotoxicity exacerbates hyperglycemia by impairing insulin secretion and sensitivity, necessitating effective interventions. Although short-term intensive insulin therapy (SIIT) mitigates glucotoxicity, the effect of combining SIIT with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in hospitalised type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with severe hyperglycemia remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining SGLT2 inhibitors with basal bolus therapy (BBT) for glycemic control in hospitalised patients with T2DM. In this randomised, open-label, single-centre trial, 35 eligible T2DM patients hospitalised for treating hyperglycemia were allocated to the BBT (n\u2009=\u200917) or BBT with empagliflozin (BBT\u2009+\u2009E) groups (n\u2009=\u200918). Patients were monitored for 7\u2009days using flash glucose monitoring. The primary outcome was time-in-range (TIR, 70-180\u2009mg\/dL). The secondary outcomes included time-above-range (TAR), time-below-range (TBR), daily glucose levels, total daily insulin dose and ketone body concentration. The BBT\u2009+\u2009E group exhibited a significantly higher TIR from day\u20092, which exceeded 70% by day\u20095, with reduced TAR and insulin requirements. Blood glucose levels declined more rapidly in the BBT\u2009+\u2009E group, accompanied by a modest ketone elevation without severe ketoacidosis. The TBR increased marginally on day\u20097, primarily nocturnally; but no symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred. The addition of SGLT2 inhibitors to BBT significantly improved early glycaemic control and reduced insulin requirements without severe ketone elevation in hospitalised T2DM patients. Routine monitoring of ketone levels and careful insulin titration are critical to ensure safety."

        "Title":"Association of neighborhood location and 30-day readmissions in patients with diabetes.",
        "Abstract":"Diabetes is one of the most common diagnoses associated with hospital admissions in the United States, costing billions to healthcare payors. An indicator of readmission risk is the Area Deprivation Index (ADI)-a measure of social determinants of health that utilizes patient residence. In this study, we assess whether ADI is associated with 30-day readmissions in patients admitted with diabetes. This retrospective cohort study included adult patients hospitalized between October 2018 and October 2023 with a diagnosis related to diabetes. The main variables included were patient demographics (including zip code as a proxy for neighborhood), comorbidities, and diabetes-related complications. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to analyze differences between ADI quartiles and readmission within 30-day postdischarge. A total of 6095 patients were included, with an average age of 57 (SD\u2009=\u200916.7); 48.4% of participants were Black, and 46.5% were female. There were 848 (14%) readmissions with diabetes. We found no significant association between any ADI groups and 30-day readmissions. Residence in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood was not shown to have a significant association with the risk of 30-day readmissions in patients with diabetes mellitus. More research is needed to understand the impact of neighborhood disadvantage on readmissions."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes is a metabolic disease that can affect people at any age. Despite being one of the leading causes of death, the treatment of diabetes is extremely difficult. For the treatment of diabetes mellitus various synthetic oral hypoglycemic drugs and insulin is available. However, insulin cannot be taken orally and the synthetic agents used can have harmful side effects. Bioactive peptides are particular protein fragments that have a beneficial impact on human health and physiological processes. These peptides can be applied as antidiabetic agents in the treatment of diabetes. The aim of the current study was to develop hypoglycemic peptides (HGPs) from plant sources and to investigate their binding interactions with selected diabetic protein receptors using peptide-protein docking, in order to identify potential peptide candidates for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The binding patterns of top seven hypoglycemic peptides with ten selected receptor proteins were explored using peptide-protein docking. The peptides P2 and P6 showed best haddock scores and binding pattern against target receptors. The P2 showed strong interactions with maltase-glucoamylase (binding energy of -108.7\u2009+\u2009\/- 9.3 kcal\/mol and with six hydrogen bonds), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (binding energy of -85.3\u2009+\u2009\/- 1.4 kcal\/mol and with three hydrogen bonds). Peptide 6 exhibited highest score against insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (binding energy of -107.5\u2009+\u2009\/- 5.4 kcal\/mol and with seven hydrogen bonds) and pancreatic alpha-amylase (binding energy of -121.3\u2009+\u2009\/- 3.1 kcal\/mol and with seven hydrogen bonds), while against Jun N-terminal kinase1 receptor peptide, the peptides P5 and P6 showed same haddock energy of -92.1\u2009+\u2009\/- 4.1 kcal\/mol having different number of hydrogen bond interactions in both complexes. The molecular dynamics simulation revealed that P6 and P2 were firmly bound to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and maltase-glucoamylase, respectively for the simulation time of 100 ns. The findings of this computational study support the data showing that these hypoglycemic peptides are effective against selected diabetic proteins. The insulin-mimetic antidiabetic peptides would be integrated into active packaging systems for the development of multi-functional materials to regulate glucose absorption. However, further assessment and validation of the particular peptides as potential therapeutic candidates for diabetes mellitus are required."

For this secondary analysis, we used logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, and the Youden index to assess associations and predictive ability of CGM metrics, including pregnancy-specific time in range (TIRp) (63-140 mg\/dL [3.5-7.8 mmol\/L]) and pregnancy outcomes. CGM metrics at 29 weeks were significantly associated with large for gestational age (LGA) and small for gestational age (SGA). Participants achieving mean glucose <110 mg\/dL (6.1 mmol\/L), TIRp \u226590%, or pregnancy-specific time above range (TARp) <10% at 29 weeks had a significantly lower risk of LGA (odds ratio [OR] 0.41 [95% CI 0.22, 0.77], 0.38 [0.20, 0.70], and 0.39 [0.20, 0.73], respectively) and SGA (0.26 [0.08, 0.79], 0.30 [0.10, 0.91], and 0.19 [0.06, 0.62], respectively).

        "Abstract":"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus caused by metabolic toxicity to peripheral axons. We aimed to gain deep mechanistic insight into the disease using transcriptomics on tibial and sural nerves recovered from lower leg amputations in a mostly diabetic population and control sural nerves from cross facial nerve graft surgery. First, comparing DPN versus control sural nerves revealed inflammatory activation and sensory changes in DPN. Second, when comparing mixed sensory and motor tibial and purely sensory sural nerves, we identified key pathway differences in affected DPN nerves, with distinct immunological features observed in sural nerves. Third, spatial transcriptomics of sural nerves revealed shifts in immune cell types associated with axonal loss progression. We also found clear evidence of neuronal transcript changes, like PRPH, in nerves with axonal loss, suggesting perturbed RNA transport into distal sensory axons. This motivated further investigation into neuronal mRNA localization in peripheral nerve axons, generating evidence of robust localization of mRNAs such as SCN9A and TRPV1 in human sensory axons. Our work provides insight into altered cellular and transcriptomic profiles in human nerves in DPN and highlights sensory axon mRNA transport as a potential contributor to nerve degeneration."

All women who had routine antenatal care at a tertiary maternity unit in United Kingdom and developed GDM were invited to attend a five-month postnatal visit between September 2023 and January 2025. Maternal demographic characteristics, medical history and pregnancy outcome were recorded and kidney dysfunction, dysglycemia, hypertension, adiposity and dyslipidemia were assessed. 817 (77%) of the 1064 eligible women attended the clinic. Women were more likely to attend if they were of Black race had chronic hypertension, family history of diabetes mellitus, or required insulin and\/or metformin as treatment for GDM control.

        "Abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasingly associated with alterations in gut microbiota, particularly under the influence of poor dietary habits during pregnancy. However, specific microbial characteristics associated with GDM remain unclear. To address this, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare the gut microbiota of pregnant women with GDM and healthy pregnant individuals. We conducted amplicon sequence variant analysis, assessed \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity, performed taxonomic profiling, and applied linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) as well as random forest modeling to identify differences in microbial composition and potential diagnostic biomarkers. Although overall microbial diversity did not differ significantly between the groups, distinct taxonomic shifts were observed. These differences suggest the presence of microbial dysbiosis associated with GDM and poor dietary patterns. Enrichment of beneficial genera in healthy pregnant individuals, along with an increased abundance of potentially dysbiotic taxa in the GDM group, highlights the potential role of gut microbiota in GDM pathogenesis. Notably, Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004 emerged as candidate biomarkers for GDM diagnosis or risk stratification. These findings provide a foundation for future investigations into microbiota-targeted interventions and the development of noninvasive diagnostic strategies for GDM."

Patients who undergo pancreatic resection may develop diabetes mellitus. To summarize the available literature reporting the incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) after pancreatic trauma and to evaluate potential influences on the incidence rates. We searched in PubMed and Embase for studies published between 1990 and July 2025 that enrolled patients with trauma of the pancreas and reported data on new-onset DM. Out of 906 identified records, six studies with a total of 297 patients with pancreatic trauma. The overall cumulative incidence of new-onset DM is 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4%-9.0%). DM developed in 8.2% (95% CI: 4.4%-13.6%) of patients who underwent (partial) pancreatic resection and in 2.9% (95% CI: 0.8%-7.4%) of patients treated nonoperatively. For low-grade injuries, the incidence of DM was 5.5% (95% CI: 2.0%-11.5%) compared to 11.1% (95% CI: 4.9%-20.7%) for high-grade injuries. The time until new-onset diabetes mellitus was detailed in one study with 15 patients. Based on the available literature, the estimated overall incidence of DM after pancreatic trauma is 5.7%. High-grade pancreatic injury seems to increase the risk of developing new-onset DM, which is possibly influenced by their frequent surgical treatment."

Apelin, a bioactive peptide, is linked to periodontitis, obesity, and T2DM. This study aimed to investigate apelin levels in individuals with periodontitis who are affected by obesity and T2DM. This cross-sectional observational study included 84 participants categorized into 3 main groups of 24 patients based on their periodontal status, body mass index (BMI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c<\/sub>) levels. Group 1 comprised systemically healthy participants, group 2 comprised individuals with obesity (BMI of 30.0 to 39.0 kg\/m2), and group 3 comprised individuals with both obesity and T2DM (HbA<sub>1c<\/sub> of 6.5% to 8.5%). Each group was subcategorized based on the presence or absence of chronic periodontitis (CP), resulting in 6 subgroups with 14 participants each. The clinical parameters assessed included the Sulcus Bleeding Index (SBI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), BMI, and HbA<sub>1c<\/sub> level. Apelin levels in serum and saliva were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance and independent samples t test. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess relationships between different parameters. Within groups, individuals with CP had lower serum and salivary levels of apelin than those without CP, and the differences were statistically significant except in the case of salivary levels in patients with obesity (P < 0.05). Individuals with obesity, as well as those with both T2DM and obesity, had elevated levels of serum apelin compared with systemically healthy individuals. A significant negative correlation was observed between serum apelin and periodontal parameters (SBI, PD, and CAL) in specific subgroups. Apelin could be a valuable biomarker for evaluating periodontal disease affected by obesity and T2DM. However, further longitudinal research with a larger patient sample is needed.

Patients with intravitreal injections in the past four weeks, ocular comorbidities, active infection, or systemic vasculitis were excluded. We performed linear regression with plasma concentration of each protein as dependent variable and sex as predictor, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, smoking status, hemoglobin A1c, insulin use, and diabetes duration. We plotted the concentration of inflammatory proteins against diabetes duration for men and women separately to assess for differences over time. We conducted similar analyses for the control groups. Plasma concentrations of nine inflammatory proteins involved in DR progression were higher in NPDR men than in women. For most of these proteins, the plasma concentration was similar between men and women with fewer years of diabetes and exhibited higher levels in NPDR men with longer durations of diabetes. In those with \u226515 years of diabetes, sex differences in these inflammatory proteins were less apparent. We identified a variety of inflammatory proteins higher in the plasma of male NPDR patients than in female patients. We also found the differences to be more prominent in those who had five to 10 years of diabetes. Differences in plasma inflammatory proteins could underlie the clinically observed sex differences in DR, and earlier years of diabetes might be a potential window for closer follow-up and therapeutic intervention."

Participants reported any (\u2265\u20091\u00a0day in the past month) and chronic (\u2265\u20093 months) MSP. Additionally, the latter group reported pain locations (grouped in six pain regions) and intensity (visual analogue scale 1-10). Prevalence of any and (patterns of) chronic MSP were described across seven age groups. Logistic and multinominal regression analyses assessed associations of age groups with MSP, adjusted for sex or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Interactions between age and sex or T2DM were tested. Prevalence of any and chronic MSP was 53% and 29%, respectively. Any MSP was less common in participants aged 70-75 years compared to those aged 40-44 years (OR\u2009=\u20090.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.99). Chronic MSP plateaued after age 60 (range ORs 55-69 years 1.27-1.38). Neck\/chest\/shoulder (65%) and lower back (55%) were the most common chronic pain regions. Pain in four or more locations was reported by 43%, with no age-group differences. Sex and T2DM did not modify the relation between age group and chronic MSP. Mean pain intensity in those with chronic MSP (5.6, SD 1.7) was stable across age groups. The prevalence of chronic MSP seems not to increase further after the age of 60, possibly reflecting decreased work demands, altered pain perception, effective pain management, or selection bias of healthier older individuals."

Recently, it has gained attention as a potential prognostic marker in cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to evaluate whether the FIB-4 score, independent of its role in liver assessment, can predict short-term mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) in the emergency department (ED). In this prospective observational study, 1017 patients diagnosed with AMI and treated with CAG between May 1, 2023, and February 29, 2024, were included. Patients were stratified into three groups based on FIB-4 score: low (<\u20091.45), intermediate (1.45-3.25), and high (>\u20093.25). Clinical and laboratory data, HEART scores, angiographic findings, in-hospital and 30-day outcomes were compared across groups. Patients with FIB-4\u2009>\u20093.25 exhibited significantly higher rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (60.2%), hypertension (64%), diabetes mellitus (47.5%), atrial fibrillation (11%), and ventricular tachycardia (2.1%) (all p\u2009<\u20090.01). In-hospital mortality (14.4%), 30-day mortality (19.9%), and MACE (24.8%) were significantly elevated in this group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis identified FIB-4\u2009>\u20093.25 (OR 3.816; p\u2009=\u20090.001), HEART score (OR 1.161; p\u2009=\u20090.013), and hemoglobin (OR 0.873; p\u2009=\u20090.038) as independent predictors of mortality. ROC analysis revealed moderate discriminative performance for FIB-4 (AUC: 0.693) and HEART score (AUC: 0.766). Elevated FIB-4 scores are independently associated with increased short-term mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in AMI patients undergoing CAG. Beyond its traditional role in liver disease, the FIB-4 score may serve as a practical, non-invasive biomarker for early cardiovascular risk stratification in patients presenting to the ED with acute myocardial infarction."

Furthermore, 15-20% of these patients may develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This study aims to highlight the importance of screening and establishing guidelines for the long-term monitoring of individuals incidentally diagnosed with DPA. Over five years (2018-2024), three cases of incidentally detected DPA were identified at our institution. A male in his late 60s presented with hematuria, revealing complete DPA during imaging for bladder carcinoma. Another male in his late 60s had incidental DPA diagnosed alongside a left renal mass, while a female in her late 20s was found to have DPA during evaluation for nephrolithiasis. All patients received lifestyle counselling and were advised a structured follow-up regimen involving HbA1c monitoring, stool fat analysis, abdominal ultrasound, and echocardiography every 3 to 6 months for the first 1-2 years. Regular follow-up for patients with incidentally detected DPA is crucial due to the associated risk of DM and pancreatic insufficiency. Our findings support a proactive monitoring strategy, which ensures timely detection and management of potential complications, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. Future research should aim to establish standardised guidelines for the long-term management of DPA, particularly in asymptomatic patients."

Of all groups, GDM-LGA newborns revealed the highest levels of IGF-1, leptin, and insulin; their IGF-1 levels were even significantly higher than in GDM-non-LGA and C. None of the five biochemical parameters differed significantly between GDM and C. Elevated IGF-1 and leptin levels were associated with fetal macrosomia. IGF-1 turned out to be significantly different between LGA and non-LGA newborns of diabetic mothers, even though there were only 6 LGA cases. Metabolic differences between GDM and C infants may not be detectable with tight control of diabetes during pregnancy."

A cross-sectional survey. A total of 360 people with T2DM who were hospitalised in the endocrinology departments of two hospitals with Grade A in Daqing City between August 2024 and February 2025 were selected using a convenience sampling method. The symptoms of people with T2DM were measured using the Chinese version of the Diabetes Symptom Checklist-Revised (DSC-R). Symptom clusters were identified through factor analysis, and network analysis was used to identify core and bridging symptoms. This research adhered to the STROBE guidelines. Six symptom clusters were obtained from factor analysis, which were psychological-behavioural symptom cluster, ophthalmological-neuropathy symptom cluster, cardiovascular symptom cluster, metabolic symptom cluster, body symptom cluster and nephrotic symptom cluster. Symptom network analysis revealed that 'Deteriorating vision' exhibited the highest strength centrality and expected influence. The top three symptoms with the highest bridge strength and bridge expected influence were 'Aching calves when walking', 'Queer feeling in the legs or feet' and 'Sleepiness or drowsiness'. People with T2DM commonly exhibit a range of symptoms. 'Deteriorating vision' is the most core symptom in people with T2DM. 'Aching calves when walking', 'Queer feeling in the legs or feet' and 'Sleepiness or drowsiness' are identified as the bridging symptoms in the network analysis. Healthcare professionals can design targeted interventions based on symptom clusters, core symptoms and bridging symptoms, thereby improving the efficiency of symptom management and optimising outcomes for people with T2DM.

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase located in the mitochondria, where it regulates the activity and biological functions of diverse proteins and influences various mitochondrial functions <i>via<\/i> deacetylation. Increasing research indicates that SIRT3 holds promise as a therapeutic target for DKD. This review examines SIRT3's impact on mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, dynamics, oxidative homeostasis, and energy metabolism. We summarize that SIRT3 delays the progression of DKD by inhibiting oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, regulating cell death, and modulating energy metabolism. Finally, we categorize the applications of SIRT3 activators in renal diseases. In summary, this review provides a thorough understanding of SIRT3's functional role in DKD and proposes a potential therapeutic approach pending clinical validation."

To detect the burden of PAD\u00a0in type 2 diabetes patients using the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) and to find its correlation with glycaemic control as well as duration of diabetes mellitus. This study was conducted on 300 type 2 diabetes mellitus\u00a0patients aged 30-70 years, with diabetes for a minimum period of five years. All patients were screened for PAD by a vascular Doppler instrument using the ABI. Patients with ABI < 0.9 are subjected to colour Doppler to confirm the presence of PAD. Blood investigations, like fasting and postprandial blood glucose\u00a0and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), were also done.\u00a0Data were analysed by SPSS version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) using appropriate tests. A total of 68\u00a0(22.7%) patients out of 300, who had diabetes mellitus for more than five years, had PAD. Prevalence increases with age and duration of diabetes. There was no difference between males and females. The possibility of PAD increases with raised body mass index (BMI). A total of 38 (55.9%) out of 68 patients with PAD were asymptomatic. Claudication was the most common symptom of PAD, found in 30\u00a0(44.1%) patients. Increased systolic pressure was found to be associated with PAD.\u00a0The sensitivity and specificity of ABI in diagnosing PAD were found to be 89% and 94%, respectively. Chronic hyperglycaemia (high HbA1C) was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of PAD. ABI correlated significantly with the duration of diabetes, systolic hypertension, age, BMI, postprandial blood sugar level, and HbA1C. Prevalence of PAD in diabetes mellitus is positively associated with duration of diabetes, age, BMI, systolic hypertension, and chronic hyperglycaemia (high HbA1C). It can be easily and reliably diagnosed using the ABI (less than 0.9), which will help in early detection and management."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the association between these biomarkers and microvascular complications in individuals with DM, as well as to assess their diagnostic performance. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science following PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies examined the relationship between VAI, LAP, and AIP and microvascular complications in DM. The meta-analysis synthesized data using pooled weighted mean differences (WMDs) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values to evaluate the predictive utility of these biomarkers for DKD and DR. A total of 23 studies were included. Patients with DKD had significantly higher levels of LAP (WMD: 12.67; 95% CI: 7.83-17.51; <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u2009.01), AIP (WMD: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19; <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u2009.01), and VAI (WMD: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.38-0.89; <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u2009.01) compared to those without DKD. Additionally, each 1-unit increase in LAP (OR: 1.005; 95% CI: 1.003-1.006; <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u2009.01), AIP (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04-1.12; <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u2009.01), and VAI (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03-1.07; <i>P<\/i>\u2009<\u2009.01) was associated with an elevated risk of DKD. In contrast, no significant associations were identified between these biomarkers and DR. The diagnostic performance of VAI, LAP, and AIP was limited for both DR and DKD, with low discriminatory power. VAI, LAP, and AIP are significant predictors of DKD in individuals with DM but exhibit limited relevance for the detection of DR. Although these biomarkers show potential in identifying DKD risk, their overall diagnostic accuracy for DKD and DR remains modest, underscoring the need for further studies to enhance their clinical applicability."

After initial stabilization, he underwent paracentesis and was diagnosed with hemorrhagic ascites (HA). Post-discharge, the patient was re-admitted multiple times due to refractory HA in the setting of poor volume management. Cirrhosis was ruled out with biopsy, and subsequent workup following his initial presentation eventually revealed high-output right heart failure in the setting of severe pulmonary hypertension (undiagnosed on initial presentation). Recognizing acute presentations of hemorrhagic ascites secondary to cardiac etiology can prove challenging in a patient with long-standing ESRD in the absence of liver cirrhosis because reported cases in the literature for this specific subset of patient population are seldom. This case will discuss the methodical approach in diagnostic workup taken and emphasize the importance of considering right heart failure as a potential differential, even if a patient had no significant cardiac history on file. More research is needed to further investigate the connection between right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and hemorrhagic ascites."

This is a pilot study that evaluates the performance of the Oivi fundus camera (Oivi AS, Oslo, Norway), a novel non-mydriatic tabletop fundus camera for DR\u00a0detection using a single-field, macula-centered imaging approach. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared with that of a standard reference device, the Topcon NW400 fundus camera (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). A total of 243 subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM) were recruited. Non-mydriatic macula-centered images were captured using both cameras. Two ophthalmologists independently graded the deidentified images for image quality and DR stage. Discrepancies between their assessments were adjudicated by consensus after review by a senior ophthalmologist. The senior ophthalmologist's grading of images from the standard camera images served as the ground truth for comparative analysis. Inter-modality agreement was evaluated using linear weighted kappa (\u03ba) correlation. DR was detected in 23% of patients using the standard reference camera (12% of eyes) and in 23.86% using the tabletop camera (12.6%). Identification of moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (7.2%), severe NPDR (0.4%), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (1.23%) was similar between the two cameras, although not always in the same eyes. The inter-modality agreement (k) for DR was 0.927 (95% CI: 0.88-0.97) (almost perfect). The tabletop camera showed a sensitivity of 92.98% (95% CI, 83-98.05%) and a specificity of 99.47% (95% CI, 98.10-99.94%) for DR. The percentage of usable images was 92.3% with the standard reference camera and 95.2% with the tabletop camera. This study provides preliminary evidence that the novel tabletop Oivi fundus camera may offer comparable performance to standard non-mydriatic devices for DR detection in a single-field strategy. Its portability and usability under mesopic conditions suggest potential value for point-of-care screening. Further large-scale studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore their role in screening programs."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MDR-TB among adult pulmonary TB patients and evaluate its association with previous treatment history and other potential risk factors. Methods A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, from January to June 2024. A total of 250 adult patients with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB were enrolled using a non-probability consecutive sampling technique. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Sputum samples were tested using the GeneXpert MTB\/RIF assay, and rifampicin-resistant samples were further analyzed by culture-based drug susceptibility testing to confirm MDR-TB. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 26. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of MDR-TB. Results The overall prevalence of MDR-TB was 18.8% (47\/250). MDR-TB was significantly more prevalent in previously treated patients (40.0%) compared to newly diagnosed cases (6.9%) (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, previous TB treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.85; 95% CI: 3.85-16.00), smoking history (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.02-4.45), and diabetes mellitus (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI: 1.33-5.68) were independently associated with MDR-TB. Age and gender were not significantly associated with MDR-TB. Conclusion The study revealed a high prevalence of MDR-TB, especially among previously treated patients. Previous TB treatment, smoking, and diabetes mellitus were key risk factors. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive drug resistance screening and the integration of non-communicable disease management and tobacco control into TB care strategies."

This longitudinal study enrolled 1043 participants from a community-based cohort in Shanghai (2013-2014) and followed them for CV events through 2021-2022. The CV events included ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, hospitalization for heart failure, and coronary revascularization), ischemic stroke, and CV death. Carotid plaque was excluded via ultrasound. Visceral fat area (VFA) was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. The neck circumference (NC), neck-to-height ratio (NHtR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), neck-to-limb length ratio (NLR), and waist-to-limb length ratios (WLR) were calculated. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between various obesity-related indices (BMI, waist circumference, NC, NHtR, WHtR, WHR, NLR, and WLR) and VFA (all <i>P<\/i> < 0.001). Over a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years, 97 CV events (9.3%) were recorded. Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated that elevated NLR was significantly associated with an increased CV risk with hazard ratios of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.52). Notably, the NLR significantly improved the predictive capacity of CV events (C-statistic, 0.671 [95% CI: 0.616-0.726], <i>P<\/i> = 0.002; NRI, 0.090 [95% CI: 0.003-0.177], <i>P<\/i> < 0.001; IDI, 0.007 [95% CI: 0.000-0.019], <i>P<\/i> < 0.001).

Mean PCAT attenuation \u2265\u2009-70.5 Hounsfield Units (HU) corresponds to elevated inflammation and a higher future risk of myocardial infarction. While statins are known to possess anti-inflammatory properties, the impact of statin intensity on vascular inflammation remains underexplored in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary atherosclerosis. We aim to evaluate whether high-intensity statins are associated with lower PCAT attenuation in this high-risk cohort.

It represents the third most common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury, accounting for approximately 11% of cases. CIN increases short-term morbidity and mortality while accelerating the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and short-term outcomes of CIN among CKD patients undergoing contrast studies at 2 tertiary care centers in Sri Lanka. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the nephrology units of Colombo North Teaching Hospital and Teaching Hospital Kurunegala from August 2018 to September 2023. The study included 405 CKD patients over 18 years referred for pre-procedural nephrology consultation before undergoing contrast-enhanced imaging. All patients received intravenous normal saline hydration (1\u2005mL\/kg\/h) 12 hours before and after contrast administration, with temporary discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications. Data was collected via an interviewer-administered questionnaire. CIN was defined per KDIGO guidelines as a rise in serum creatinine >25% or 0.5\u2005mg\/dL from baseline. The mean age of patients was 62.6 years (SD\u2005=\u200512.4), with 310 (76.5%) being male. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (48.9%), hypertension (44.2%), coronary artery disease (13.3%), and chronic liver disease (6.2%). CIN occurred in 45 patients (11.1%), with diabetes mellitus identified as a significant risk factor (P\u2005=\u2005.0044). Arterial contrast administration had a higher risk (17.7%) than venous administration (10.7%). Seven patients (1.7%) required acute hemodialysis, and 1 patient died. Age, gender, and CKD stage did not significantly influence CIN development. CIN remains a common complication in CKD patients undergoing contrast studies, with diabetes mellitus being a significant independent risk factor. Pre-procedural risk assessment and appropriate prophylactic measures are essential to minimize CIN incidence and associated complications."

        "Abstract":"Primary heavy and light chain amyloidosis (AHL) is extremely rare globally. This study aimed to report the first clinical treatment of AHL secondary diabetes. We also analyzed fasting blood glucose levels across various treatments. Finally, a reference was provided for treatment and laboratory indicators in AHL with secondary diabetes. The patient was treated in Department of Hematology in Deyang People's Hospital. He underwent treatment with daratumumab (DARA) + cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD), autologous stem cell transplantation and bortezomib for AHL, alongside empagliflozin for blood glucose management. Clinical data and laboratory results were collected during phases of treatment and follow-up. This patient was a middle-aged man with 2 months of swelling in both lower limbs. Tests, including serum and urine analyses and a kidney biopsy, diagnosed him with AHL (IgA-\u03bb). He was diagnosed with diabetes after 4 courses of DARA + CyBorD. Then DARA was discontinued. CyBorD, autologous stem cell transplantation, and bortezomib were continued for AHL, alongside empagliflozin for blood glucose management. Finally, very good partial remission and effective control of blood sugar were obtained. Current study presented a case of AHL with secondary diabetes following treatment with DARA + CyBorD. For patients with high fasting blood glucose undergoing targeted therapy or chemotherapy, oral glucose tolerance test and glycosylated hemoglobin tests were necessary for the overall health. The difference between free light chain trend changed earlier than 24-hour urine protein, offering guidance for early AHL treatment and enhancing patient quality of life."

        "Abstract":"Low medication adherence is one of the leading causes that affect glycemic control and the achievement of target levels for type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is hypothesized that negative beliefs about medications and high health anxiety may reduce adherence, while positive treatment beliefs could enhance it. This study aims to assess the impact of treatment beliefs and health anxiety on medication adherence among individuals with T2DM. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 356 T2DM patients. The study was conducted between July 2022 and January 2023 in a state hospital in Turkiye. Data were collected using the Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale (MGLS), the beliefs about medicines questionnaire [BMQ-Turkish translation (BMQ-T)] and the health anxiety inventory (HAI). According to the study's findings, 42.7% of the participants adhered to the treatment. The mean age of the participants was 60.64\u2005\u00b1\u200512.13 years. It was found that with a low level of education, namely illiterate patients (\u03b2\u2005=\u20051.625, P\u2005=\u2005.003) and primary school graduates (\u03b2\u2005=\u20050.995, P\u2005=\u2005.008), the BMQ-T subscales of specific necessity (\u03b2\u2005=\u2005-0.340, P\u2005=\u2005.016) and general harm (\u03b2\u2005=\u20050.445, P\u2005=\u2005.001) had an independent predictor effect on medication adherence scores. Health anxiety was not found to affect treatment adherence (P\u2005=\u2005.947). Based on the findings of this study, low education levels, along with negative beliefs about the necessity of treatment and concerns about medication harm, are significant independent predictors of low medication adherence. To improve adherence, targeted educational interventions should be developed to address these misconceptions, focusing on patients with lower education levels. Additionally, policy changes should integrate structured educational programs and guidance on the benefits and safety of treatment, ensuring long-term adherence support for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

        "Abstract":"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common metabolic complication following kidney transplantation and is associated with an increased risk of graft failure, cardiovascular disease, infections, and mortality. We prospectively analyzed the risk factors and clinical consequences of PTDM in patients who underwent kidney transplantation at our center. The study included 130 transplant recipients without preexisting diabetes (79 males, 51 females; mean age: 47.6 years). PTDM was defined as the requirement for pharmacologic treatment at least 3 months after transplantation or based on the oral glucose tolerance test. The observation period ranged from 4 to 75 months. The incidence of PTDM was 21.5% (28\/130). Patients who developed PTDM were older (P\u2005=\u2005.02) and had a higher body mass index (P\u2005=\u2005.04). Median fasting glucose and HbA1c levels prior to transplantation were significantly higher in patients who later developed PTDM. No significant differences were observed in sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, dialysis method or duration, number of HLA mismatches, frequency of acute rejection, delayed graft function, reoperation, graft function, steroid dose, or baseline serum levels of insulin, C-peptide, lipid profile, or markers of insulin resistance. Tacrolimus was part of the immunosuppressive regimen in 89% of PTDM patients and 78% of non-PTDM patients (P\u2005>\u2005.05). In this cohort, general risk factors for diabetes appeared to play a greater role in the development of PTDM than transplantation-specific variables. Simple pre-transplant indicators such as blood glucose and HbA1c may help identify patients at increased risk of PTDM."

        "Abstract":"Effective management of blood glucose levels in elderly patients with diabetes is crucial in healthcare and has seen significant advancements. However, there is a lack of bibliometric analyses in this field. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview through bibliometric analysis. A bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection to identify research trends in blood glucose management for elderly patients with diabetes from 2000 to 2024. The analysis utilized VOSviewer version 1.6.20, CiteSpace version 6.3.R1, and R version 4.3.3 to visualize collaboration networks and emerging research trends. A total of 11,826 publications were analyzed, sourced from 134 countries and 228 institutions between 2000 and 2024. There has been a consistent increase in publications, particularly from 2020 to 2022. The United States was the leading contributor, with 2436 publications, while Harvard University had the highest output at 829 publications. Among the journals, Diabetes Care was the most impactful based on its high Hirsch index. Influential authors included Beck Roy W and Khunti Kamlesh. Keyword analysis identified \"continuous glucose monitoring,\" \"weight,\" \"progression,\" \"young adults,\" \"classification,\" and \"time in range\" as primary research themes since 2017. This bibliometric analysis provides a detailed overview of blood glucose management in elderly diabetic patients. Key focus areas such as \"continuous glucose monitoring,\" \"time in range,\" and \"weight\" have gained significant attention. Future research should further explore these themes, especially the role of continuous glucose monitoring and the concept of time in range in clinical practice."

        "Abstract":"This umbrella meta-analysis comprehensively evaluates the effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) in managing glycemic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Following PRISMA guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO database for transparency, a thorough literature search was conducted across key databases, including EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed. The review focuses on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting adults with T2DM, with methodological quality assessed using the AMSTAR2 tool. The findings reveal that LCDs resulted in significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in 16 out of 21 studies, indicating substantial short-term improvements in glycemic control. However, four studies reported no significant changes, highlighting individual variability in responses. While some studies showed reductions in fasting blood glucose, results were inconclusive overall. Insulin sensitivity improved during the short term, but these benefits were not sustained over the long term. Overall, the analysis suggests that LCDs provide considerable short-term glycemic control benefits for T2DM patients, alongside potential long-term advantages. Further research is necessary to develop personalized dietary strategies that address the diverse needs of different populations, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of diabetes management."

        "Abstract":"The global prevalence of pregestational type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased concurrently with increasing rates of overweight and obesity. Effective weight management during pregnancy is critically associated with maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, no universally accepted guidelines for gestational weight gain (GWG) in high-risk pregnancies with T2DM currently exist. A nationwide, multicenter cohort of 2078 T2DM pregnancies was analyzed, categorizing GWG based on latest Chinese guidelines. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of GWG deviations on adverse pregnancy outcomes. Interquartile range (IQR) analysis and restricted cubic splines were used to determine BMI-specific GWG targets. The results showed that insufficient GWG was protective against cesarean delivery, large-for-gestational-age (LGA), and macrosomia but increased risks of preterm birth and congenital anomalies. Excessive GWG significantly elevated risks of preeclampsia, LGA, macrosomia, and neonatal hypoglycemia, while protecting against small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Using interquartile range method, we identified GWG ranges for normal-weight, overweight, and obese women were 7.0-12.5\u00a0kg, 5.0-11.0\u00a0kg, and 4.0-11.2\u00a0kg, respectively. Restricted cubic splines suggested relaxing the lower limit to 6\u00a0kg for normal BMI but showed risks below 1.8\u00a0kg. For overweight and obese women, GWG below guideline limits was beneficial. The current GWG guidelines may not fully suit T2DM pregnancies, particularly for overweight and obese women, highlighting the need for BMI-specific recommendations to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic erectile dysfunction (DMED) is a prevelant urological complication in diabetic men. Increased oxidative stress accompanied with diminished Nrf2 antioxidant pathway has been shown to impair NO\/cGMP signaling and distrupt the penile vascular endothelial function in DMED. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a clinically approved Nrf2 activator used for psoriasis and multiple sclerosis, in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DMED. Male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with a single intraperitoneal dose of STZ (60\u00a0mg\/kg) to induce DMED. At week 8, both diabetic and nondiabetic rats were treated orally with DMF (25 or 100\u00a0mg\/kg) or vehicle for 4\u00a0weeks. At week 12, erectile function was evaluated by measuring the intracavernosal pressure (ICP) responses to the electrical stimulation of cavernous nerves. Penile tissues were collected for biochemical and molecular analysis. DMED occurred in diabetic rats, evidenced by reduced the maximum ICP\/ mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total ICP\/MAP ratios. The penile tissues of diabetic rats exhibited increased MDA level along with decreased Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels, SOD and CAT activities, and reduced phosphorylated eNOS at serine 1177 and phosphorylated VASP at serine 239. Treatment with DMF at 100\u00a0mg\/kg was effectively reversed these functional reponses and tissue biochemical alterations in DMED rats. This study provides the first evidence that DMF improved DMED by alleviating oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction via the activation of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, suggesting a potential clinical repurposing of DMF for DMED."

Subtraction techniques can mitigate these artifacts, thereby enhancing diagnostic precision. However, the potential of subtraction FFR-CT and the pericoronary fat attenuation index (FAI) to improve the prediction of revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FFR-CT and pericoronary FAI in identifying the need for revascularization in patients with CAD. We retrospectively analyzed coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data from 76 patients with CAD (142 branches) using both conventional and subtraction CCTA images. The diagnostic performance of FFR-CT and FAI in identifying revascularization needs was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Among the 76 patients, 54 underwent revascularization. Patients who underwent revascularization had higher pericoronary FAI and lower FFR-CT values. Subtraction FFR-CT values were higher than those obtained using conventional methods. Models 4 (subtraction CCTA), 5 (Model 4\u2009+\u2009subtraction FFR-CT), and 6 (Model 5\u2009+\u2009subtraction FAI) showed significantly better diagnostic efficacy for revascularization needs than compared to the Models 1 (conventional CCTA), 2 (Model 1\u2009+\u2009conventional FFR-CT), and 3 (Model 2\u2009+\u2009conventional FAI) (all <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.05).

However, the biologic basis of HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) as a distinct biologic entity distinct from HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) and reduced EF (HFrEF) has not been well characterized. The EXSCEL trial randomized participants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) exenatide (EQW) vs. placebo. For this study, profiling of ~\u20095000 proteins using the SomaLogic SomaScan platform was performed in baseline and 12-month serum samples from N\u2009=\u20091199 participants with prevalent HF at baseline. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA (FDR p\u2009<\u20090.1) were used to identify proteins that were significantly between three EF groups (EF\u2009>\u200955% [HFpEF], EF 40-55% [HFmrEF], EF\u2009<\u200940% [HFrEF], categories as previously curated in the parent trial). Cox proportional hazards was used to assess association between baseline levels of proteins significantly different between groups, and changes in protein level between baseline and 12-month, with time-to-HF hospitalization. Mixed models were used to assess whether significant proteins changed differentially with exenatide vs. placebo therapy. Of N\u2009=\u20091199 EXSCEL participants with prevalent HF, 284 (24%), 704 (59%) and 211 (18%) had HFpEF, HFmrEF and HFrEF, respectively. Eight principal components analysis (PCA) protein factors differed significantly across the three EF groups, of which 270 individual proteins within those factors were significant. The majority of proteins (75%) demonstrated similar levels in HFmrEF and HFpEF with higher levels in HFrEF. Biologic pathways of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, ECM receptor interaction (tenascin C [TNC], COL28A1), complement and coagulation cascades, and epithelial apical surface and junctions demonstrated enrichment among proteins with this dominant pattern. A minority of proteins (1%) demonstrated similar levels between HFmrEF and HFrEF with lower levels in HFpEF, including MMP-9 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Baseline levels of the majority of the 270 proteins (92%) were also associated with time-to-incident HF hospitalization including domains of extracellular matrix (COL28A1, TNC), angiogenesis (VEGFa, VEGFd), myocyte stretch (NT-proBNP), and renal function (cystatin-C). Change in levels of 8% of these from baseline to 12 months (including increase in TNC) predicted incident HF hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Levels of 41% of the 270 significant proteins (including TNC and NT-proBNP; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) were reduced differentially by EQW compared with placebo. In conclusion, we found that serum levels of the vast majority of proteins across multiple biologic domains were similar between HFmrEF and HFpEF suggesting that HFmrEF may be more biologically similar to HFpEF than HFrEF. We also identified specific biomarkers showing this pattern, most notably TNC, for which baseline and change levels predicted incident HF hospitalization and were beneficially modified by the GLP-1 RA EQW. These results may offer unique data on prognosis and pharmacotherapy modification with variability by EF."

A total of 184 panoramic radiographs from patients with T1DM-each of whom was receiving insulin therapy-and 184 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals were retrospectively evaluated. A newly developed Python-based module was used to calculate FD with a single click in six predefined mandibular regions of interest (ROIs), including gonial, interdental, and condylar areas. The significance of the test results was determined according to the p\u2009<\u20090.05 level. There were no statistically significant differences in FD values between groups in the condylar region (ROI 1 and 6). However, FD values in ROI 2, 3, 4, and 5-corresponding to the gonial and interdental areas-were significantly higher in the T1DM group compared to controls, suggesting microstructural differences in trabecular bone. The results indicate that T1DM is associated with region-specific alterations in mandibular trabecular bone architecture. The single-click fractal analysis module demonstrated efficient and standardized assessment of bone structure, offering a promising tool for clinical and research applications."

The role of neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (NHR) in GDM is unclear. This study aims to explore the predictive value of early pregnancy NHR in GDM. A case-control study was conducted involving 1421 pregnant women, randomly divided into a training dataset and a validation set. Routine clinical and laboratory information were collected. Logistic regression was performed and nomogram was established to determine the diagnostic efficacy of NHR for GDM. We evaluated nomogram through receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Compared with non-GDM, early pregnancy NHR was significantly elevated in GDM. Logistic regression indicated that NHR was an independent risk factor for GDM. A nomogram model was constructed using NHR, age, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, and fasting blood glucose as factors to predict GDM in early pregnancy. The calibration curve and DCA demonstrated strong predictive ability. The DCA result indicated that the model has clinical application value. In GDM subjects, NHR levels significantly increase in early pregnancy and are closely related to the occurrence of GDM. NHR has good predictive diagnostic performance."

At baseline, LV remodeling index (g\/ml) was higher in T2DM\u00a0+\u00a0OSA (0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12; 0.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10; 0.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13; 0.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16*; respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01vs. control), whereas RV remodeling index was similar (0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; 0.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; 0.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; 0.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04; p\u00a0=\u00a00.33). The difference in LV remodeling index persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The diagnoses of OSA only (b coefficient: 0.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), and of OSA\u00a0+\u00a0T2DM (interaction term; b coefficient: 0.11, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were associated with adverse LV but not RV remodeling. CPAP treatment for 3\u00a0months prevented progression of adverse LV remodeling [difference: CPAP: -0.01 (-0.08, 0.08) g\/ml; sham: 0.11 (-0.03, 0.17) g\/ml; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03)] but not RV remodeling [difference: CPAP: 0.01 (-0.04, 0.08) g\/ml; sham: 0.003 (-0.02, 0.04) g\/ml; p\u00a0=\u00a00.82)]. The overlap of T2DM and OSA had an incremental effect on adverse LV remodeling but not RV remodeling. CPAP prevented the progression of LV but not RV remodeling."

        "Abstract":"Mulberry leaf (Morus alba L.), traditionally recorded in \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" for diabetes treatment. Mulberry leaf water extract (MLE) has also been shown in modern studies to improve blood glucose levels while restoring gut microbiota homeostasis and increasing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels. However, the causal relationship between MLE-promoted SCFAs elevation and improvements in glucose\/lipid metabolism as well as the exact mechanism, remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify the causal relationship between MLE-promoted SCFAs elevation and improvements in glucose\/lipid metabolism as well as the exact mechanism. db\/db mice received antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion to generate pseudo-germ-free model, followed by parallel interventions: fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MLE (4\u00a0g crude drug\/kg)-treated or untreated donors, and direct SCFAs supplementation. Glucose and lipid metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (IWAT), and hepatic steatosis\/inflammation were evaluated through biochemical assays, qRT-PCR and histology. Protein expressions in adipose tissues were assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and fecal SCFAs levels were detected by targeted metabolomics. Both FMT-MLE and SCFAs treatments demonstrated marked metabolic benefits, including enhanced glucose\/lipid homeostasis, improved lipid metabolism, alleviated hepatic steatosis and inflammation, restored microbial balance, and elevated SCFAs concentrations. Mechanistically, mice treated with FMT-MLE and SCFAs showed increased BAT activity and exhibited increased energy expenditure, and browning of WAT. Additionally, FMT-MLE and SCFAs upregulated the protein expression of phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), p-AMPK\/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) in BAT and IWAT. MLE-modulated gut microbiota ameliorates T2DM via SCFAs-activated AMPK\/SIRT1\/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling , promoting WAT browning and BAT activation."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). In clinical practice, albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are the main characteristics of DKD. Later studies revealed that interstitial damage is also observed as DKD occurs. Therefore, the application of a biomarker for early DKD detection was critical. This systematic review aimed to summarize the literature about the prognostic role of cystatin C in kidney injury in children and adolescents with T1D. From inception until September 24, 2024, an extensive literature search through major databases (MEDLINE\/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) was carried out to investigate the prognostic role of cystatin C in kidney injury in pediatric patients with T1D. The mean difference was used for continuous outcomes with 95%CI. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A quality assessment of included studies was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We included eleven studies with 2199 participants in this systematic review. The meta-analysis included four studies. No statistically significant difference was observed in serum cystatin C levels between patients with T1D and the control group. Although individual studies showed some benefit of using serum cystatin C for the prognosis of DKD in pediatric patients with T1D, the meta-analysis of included studies reached no statistical significance. Future clinical studies should focus on the prognostic role of cystatin C (serum and urinary) in identifying kidney injury in pediatric patients with T1D."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent global health issue, with obesity being a major contributing factor to its rise. Consequently, the discovery of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes and obesity is of critical importance. In this context, 14 medicinal plants were evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory effects on \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase that involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Additionally, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents, along with antioxidant activities of the extracts, were assessed. Alhagi maurorum methanol extract exhibited strong \u03b1-glucosidase (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 45.16\u00a0\u00b5g\/mL) and moderate pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity (46.47%). Moderate \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity was observed only in the methanol extracts of Crocus ancyrensis and Scabiosa rotata (38.54% and 28.79%, respectively). Extracts of Tilia tomentosa, Thymus praecox, and Berberis crataegina, which contained high levels of total phenolics and flavonoids, also demonstrated notable antioxidant activity. Quantitative analysis of chlorogenic acid, rutin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, and hesperidin was carried out using RP-HPLC on the methanol extract of A. maurorum, which showed the most significant \u03b1-glucosidase and lipase inhibition. On the basis of these findings, it can be concluded that activity-guided fractionation of A. maurorum methanol extract may lead to the identification of novel compounds with antidiabetic potential."

        "Abstract":"Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activators (rtPA) effectively dissolve blood clots and improve symptoms in patients with acute ischemic stroke and myocardial infraction. Although rtPA are used in patients taking antiplatelets or anticoagulants to improve clinical outcomes, combination therapy may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, few studies have investigated the risk of HT and ICH associated with these combination therapies. This study aimed to investigate the adverse-event and drug-drug interaction signals for HT and ICH under combination therapy with alteplase and various antiplatelets or anticoagulants, using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. Adverse-event signals were evaluated using the reporting odds ratio and information components, and drug-drug interaction signals were studied using the \u03a9 shrinkage measure, additive, multiplicative, and Chi-square statistics models. We also investigated predictors of HT and ICH, time-to-onset, and outcomes in patients receiving alteplase. HT and\/or ICH signals were detected in patients receiving alteplase in combination with aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, cilostazol, ozagrel sodium, direct oral anticoagulants, warfarin potassium, heparin group, or argatroban. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were significant risk factors for alteplase-induced HT. Most HT and ICH events occurred within 1 day after alteplase administration, and more than 60% of affected patients were not in recovery. In conclusion, continued monitoring is required in patients receiving alteplase in combination with any of the eight types of antiplatelets or the aforementioned anticoagulants. Additionally, the occurrence of HT or ICH within 1 day post-alteplase administration should be considered in patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The findings from this study may help in understanding the risk of HT and ICH induced by rtPA in patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications, as well as in promoting the appropriate use of rtPA. Further prospective observational studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to assess these finding."

        "Abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of finerenone in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in the real-world medical setting and explore the underlying mechanism of its kidney-protecting effects from the perspective of the inflammatory response. Forty-eight DKD patients were selected and completed a 6-month finerenone treatment. Renal parameters, inflammatory cytokines, other related indicators and adverse effects were collected at every visit. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted on the microalbuminuria group (baseline urinary albumin\/creatinine ratio (UACR) 30 -\u2009<\u2009300 mg\/g) and the macroalbuminuria group (baseline UACR\u2009\u2265\u2009300 mg\/g). After finerenone treatment, the levels of UACR, urinary \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-MG) and proinflammatory cytokines in patients decreased compared with the pretreatment levels. Moreover, the rates of decrease in the UACR levels in the macroalbuminuria group were significantly greater than those in the microalbuminuria group. In the initial stage of treatment, the patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level decreased and serum potassium level increased compared to before, but with prolongation of the treatment time, both eGFR and serum potassium levels remained stable. With the assistance of RAS inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists, finerenone effectively reduces urinary protein and improves the inflammatory response, demonstrating relatively manageable safety in real-world DKD treatment. The patients with macroalbuminuria may experience greater benefits."

Nonetheless, adoption of recent versions of CGMs in this population has been complicated by concerns about interstitial volume expansion, interfering substances, and effects of dialysis treatment. This study aimed to examine the accuracy of the G6 Pro and G7 CGM systems (Dexcom, Inc.) compared with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) in a dialysis population. <b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> Twelve participants treated with maintenance dialysis (11 hemodialysis, 1 peritoneal dialysis [PD]) with diabetes wore concurrent G6 Pro and G7 CGMs for a period of 10 days, during which they measured SMBG using a Contour Next glucometer. We summarized CGM-glucometer Pearson correlations, calculated the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of G6 Pro\/G7 and SMBG, created Diabetes Technology Society (DTS) error grids, and investigated the CGM lag time that most closely corresponded with SMBG. <b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b> Mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of participants was 50 (12) years, 50% were female, mean (SD) diabetes duration was 24 (9) years, and 92% used insulin. Participants collected 245 SMBG measurements\u00a0over a total of 178 days of CGM. The Pearson correlations of G6 Pro and SMBG, G7 and SMBG, and G6 Pro and G7 were 0.87, 0.88, and 0.95, respectively. The MARDs of G6 Pro versus SMBG and G7 versus SMBG were 21.2% and 16.7%, respectively; excluding one PD participant with highly variable glucose, MARDs were 18.3% and 13.5%. The DTS error grids showed that 96.7% of G6 Pro and 98.0% of G7 measurements were clinically acceptable (Zones A\/B) when compared with SMBG. We observed evidence of greater lag times than previously seen in nondialysis populations and substantial between- and within-person variability in CGM performance. <b><i>Conclusions:<\/i><\/b> Among patients with diabetes treated with maintenance dialysis, CGM measurements of glucose had high correlation with SMBG, with better performance of the G7 compared with G6 Pro. MARD was higher than previously reported in nondialysis populations, but most values fell within clinically acceptable ranges. While issues around lag time, sensor placement, and interfering substances that may impact CGM performance warrant further investigation, our study findings support the use of CGM to evaluate glycemia in the dialysis population."

We included 4,207 women with a history of GDM from the Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2021). UPF intake (servings\/day) was assessed via food frequency questionnaires every 4 years and quantified per the NOVA classification. Diet quality was evaluated using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI). Associations between UPF intake changes and weight changes (kg) were assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) (n = 3,781). Cox regression models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of habitual UPF intake modeled by time-updated cumulative averages with T2D risk. Joint associations of UPF and AHEI with weight change and T2D risk were examined using the same GEE and Cox regression models, respectively. T2D developed in 1,040 participants. Increased UPF consumption was associated with greater weight gain (P-trend < 0.0001; quartile [Q]1 vs. Q4: 0.52 kg vs. 1.65 kg). Habitual UPF consumption was positively associated with T2D risk: adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for Q1 to Q4 were 1.00 (ref), 1.07 (0.87, 1.32), 1.25 (1.03, 1.53), and 1.20 (0.99, 1.46), respectively (P-trend = 0.04). These associations persisted in women with higher AHEI scores. When modeling UPF and AHEI jointly, only women with stable or decreased UPF intake and increased AHEI achieved 4-year weight maintenance. In women with a history of GDM, UPF consumption was associated with weight gain and higher T2D risk, even among those with higher diet quality."

        "Abstract":"The use of islet-like cells derived from ductal cells has emerged as a potential approach for treating type 1 diabetes. Diabetic patients have insufficient insulin synthesis in their bodies due to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells responsible for making insulin. Within this framework, the objective of islet cell transplantation is to reinstate the ability of patients to produce insulin. However, obstacles such as the insufficient acquisition of islet cells from donor pancreases and immune reactions hinder the broad application of this therapy method. Under specific circumstances, pancreatic ductal cells possess the capability to transform into cells that produce insulin. These cells could be cultivated in a controlled environment and converted into islet-like cells that have the capability to release insulin, making them suitable for transplantation. This innovative strategy offers the potential to halt the progression of type 1 diabetes and reduce dependence on insulin injections. In this study, islet-like cells derived from ductal cells were transplanted into the liver through the portal vein of the liver in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Following transplantation, we noted substantial reductions in the rats' blood glucose levels starting on day 5, which continued for 15 days. In addition, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) demonstrated that diabetic rats receiving the islet-like cell transplants produced significantly more insulin than the control group. These results suggest that islet-like cells derived from ductal cells may be a promising therapeutic approach for diabetes. The primary obstacles in this field of study include achieving sufficient functional capability for the cells, shielding them from the immune system, and ensuring their safety for therapeutic application. Future studies endeavors have the potential to yield crucial insights for optimizing the use of these cells in therapeutic settings, with a focus on enhancing both efficacy and safety."

MASLD contributes to serious complications in individuals with T2DM, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, variceal bleeding, hepatic decompensation, and death. Via a search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Embase (no date restrictions) this review explores the rationale for screening for MASLD in patients with T2DM and highlights the nutritional, pharmacological, and interventional advantages of early diagnosis. In particular, we examine the effectiveness of novel anti-fibrotic therapies, recently assessed in clinical trials. Alongside these potential benefits, we consider the financial implications for the healthcare system and possible adverse effects on patients. To contextualize the discussion, we compare MASLD screening with the established diabetic retinopathy screening program in England and reference the World Health Organization's principles for disease screening. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the implementation of a MASLD screening program for patients with T2DM. Key evidence gaps remain, particularly regarding: (1) the natural history of MASLD in patients with T2DM; (2) optimal timing and utilization of novel anti-fibrotic therapies; and (3) the impact of screening on major adverse liver outcomes compared to targeted testing approaches."

A total of 180 participants aged 20-65 years were divided into three groups: untreated type II DM (n = 60), treated type II DM (n = 60), and healthy controls (n = 60). Blood samples were collected, and blood cell indices were analyzed using an automated hematology analyzer. The patient's demographic characteristics, hemoglobin (Hb), fasting and postprandial glucose level, and HbA1C (%) were measured and correlated with RBC indices. RBC morphology was examined through bright-field and scanning electron microscopy. A significant reduction in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and packed cell volume in both treated and untreated type II DM groups was observed than in controls. Hb levels were significantly higher in untreated male patients, while untreated females had lower Hb levels. Significant increases in burr cells and acanthocytes were observed in type II DM patients, suggesting impaired RBC function due to hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. Negative correlations between MCV, MCH, and HbA1C levels were observed, indicating that higher blood sugar levels were associated with smaller RBCs and reduced Hb content. The study also highlighted gender-specific differences in RBC indices, with female patients showing a greater reduction in MCHC. These findings suggest that type II DM significantly affects RBC morphology and function, emphasizing the need for early monitoring and management of blood glucose levels to prevent further hematological complications."

        "Abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with few therapeutic options. Observational data suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) might protect against ALS, yet the mechanisms are unclear. Clarifying whether glucose or lipid metabolism underpins this protective effect could guide targeted interventions. This study aims to investigate if T2DM reduces ALS risk through glycemic or lipid pathways using a two-step Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach. Summary-level genetic data were sourced from FinnGen (n\u2009=\u2009440,735), MAGIC (n\u2009=\u2009200,622), UK Biobank (n\u2009=\u2009115,078), and Project MinE (n\u2009=\u2009138,086). Two-sample MR assessed T2DM's causal effect on ALS, followed by multivariable MR adjusting for glycemic traits to identify metabolic pathways. A two-step MR analyzed significant blood metabolites contributing to the T2DM-ALS relationship. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. T2DM exhibited a protective causal association with ALS (inverse variance weighting OR\u2009=\u20090.956, 95% CI 0.916-0.997, p\u2009=\u20090.037). Glycemic traits did not mediate this protection; instead, lipid metabolism played a role. Specifically, a 1 SD reduction in LDL diameter was linked to a 16.7% decrease in ALS risk, accounting for 24.4% of T2DM's protective effect. Similarly, a 1 SD decrease in total esterified cholesterol (TEC) reduced ALS risk by about 13.2%, contributing to 13.3% of T2DM's overall protective impact. No evidence of horizontal pleiotropy was observed. T2DM's protective influence on ALS primarily involves lipid rather than glucose pathways, highlighting TEC and LDL particle diameter as crucial mediators. Targeting lipid metabolism may offer new therapeutic strategies to reduce ALS risk or progression, potentially leading to focused nutritional interventions and biomarker development."

The M1\/M2 imbalance can trigger the initiation of islet autoimmunity and persists throughout the entire process of type 1 diabetes. The identification of macrophage transcriptional clusters and phenotypes by single-cell sequencing has facilitated in-depth studies on the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Macrophages exert extensive endocrine and paracrine effects on the islets by secreting various bioactive chemicals, especially exosomes, which facilitate cell-cell communication. Resident islet macrophages directly influence the biological properties of islet tissue. Meanwhile, the interaction between macrophages and islet cells is bidirectional. Cell-cell interactions also closely govern the polarization and activity of macrophages. An imbalance in the transition from M2 to M1 macrophages may lead to inflammation and islet dysfunction. Here, we have discussed the latest research progress on macrophages in the islet immune microenvironment homeostasis, the mechanisms of interactions between macrophages and islet cells in type 1 diabetes, and analyzed the possible clinical consequences. Furthermore, we highlighted emerging technologies for non-invasive detection of macrophages and summarized how therapeutic targeting of macrophages may be beneficial for patients with type 1 diabetes."

ENTPD1, also known as CD39, is an extracellular nucleotidase associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD), but its role in DFUs remains unclear. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we obtain the genetic, functional, trajectory, and communication differences between DFUs and healthy subjects. Then, we selected vascular endothelial cells (Vasendo) for further re-clustering to identify DFU-healing-promoted ENTPD1+ Vasendo and related ligand-receptor pairs in cell communication. The study demonstrated that ICD level and ENTPD1 expression were strongly correlated with DFUs, exhibiting greater enrichment in the Healing DFUs group than the Non-healing group. The Vasendo in the Healing group were enriched in the healing of DFUs and exhibited complex cellular communication. Re-clustering of Vasendo further identified the ENTPD1+ subtype. The trajectory and cell communication analysis further confirmed the healing-promoting effects of ENTPD1+ Vasendo, with inhibited ACKR1 receptor and MIF ligand when communicating with macrophages. Finally, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) Mendelian randomization and bulk sequencing validation data confirmed that upregulated expression of ANKIB1 and ANP32E with downregulated expression of SLC30A7 and TMF1 genes in DFUs Vasendo increased the risk of secondary diabetic peripheral artery disease (DPAD). Our study demonstrated the molecular mechanisms underlying DFUs healing and secondary DPAD occurrence, providing potential therapeutic targets for DFUs and DPAD therapy."

This mimic (hprt4-18) peptide activates insB9-23-specific T cells, and P. distasonis colonization enhanced diabetes in NOD mice. However, the impact of the P. distasonis colonization on inflammation, gut microbiome, intestinal immune cells, gut permeability, cytokine, and serum metabolome profiles remained unknown. Here, we investigated these effects using specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) female NOD mice. P. distasonis colonization minimally impacted gut microbiome composition, altering only 28 ASVs. In P. distasonis-colonized mice, there was a reduction in T-helper, T-effector, and B-cell populations in the intraepithelial lymphocytes, indicating a potential decrease in immune activation. Furthermore, P. distasonis colonization did not alter serum metabolome and circulating cytokine profiles (except for a decrease in IL-15) and gut permeability gene expressions. P. distasonis colonization in GF NOD mice induced severe insulitis without affecting gut permeability. Interestingly, mice gavaged with heat-inactivated (HI) P. distasonis did not affect insulitis scores or immune cell composition. These findings support our hypothesis that P. distasonis functions as a gut commensal, exerting no effect on the gut microbiome, metabolome, gut permeability, intestinal immune cell composition, or nonspecific immune activation. Instead, P. distasonis appears to trigger an insB9-23-specific immune response, potentially accelerating T1D onset in NOD mice through molecular mimicry."

        "Abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are frequent conditions affecting older adults, with evidence suggesting a higher predisposition for AD in diabetic patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are proposed as regulators of gene expression in the mutual pathways among these diseases. This study aimed to investigate circulating miRNAs found to be expressed both in AD and T2DM, as well as their target genes and associated molecular pathways, using systematic reviews (SRs), bioinformatics analyses, and data mining. Two independent SRs were conducted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in AD and T2DM compared to their respective controls. Searches covered major databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Cinahl, Web of Science), gray literature, and reference lists, following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and PRISMA guidelines. Results were combined to identify miRNAs shared by both AD and T2DM, with target genes extracted from miRTarBase. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using EnrichR, and relevant pathways were ranked based on gene involvement frequency with artificial intelligence tools. From the SRs (AD: 49 studies; T2DM: 104 studies), 21 miRNAs were identified as commonly expressed (10 upregulated, and 11 downregulated). 337 and 233 genes are potential targets for these down- and upregulated miRNAs, respectively. The key pathways identified from those genes were the TCR-RAS signaling cascade for downregulated miRNAs and the extracellular matrix pathway for upregulated miRNAs. Our findings highlight shared biological pathways between AD and T2DM and provide insights into their shared pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets."

        "Abstract":"Diabetes in pregnancy is common, affecting 5-10% of pregnant women. Poor glycaemic control in labour is associated with neonatal hypoglycaemia and other adverse outcomes for mother and baby, but tight glucose control is burdensome, intrusive and may not always be necessary. The ideal intrapartum glucose target level is unknown, traditionally 'tight' control (target 4-7\u00a0mmol\/l) has been recommended; however, this increases the risk of maternal hypoglycaemia. To determine the feasibility of a randomised clinical trial to compare clinical and cost-effectiveness of permissive versus intensive intrapartum glycaemic control in labour in pregnancies complicated by diabetes. A mixed-methods study including audit of clinical guidelines from United Kingdom maternity units, online surveys of women with diabetes and healthcare professionals, service evaluation of intrapartum glycaemic care, Delphi survey and consensus meeting. Data from these work packages led to the design of a clinical trial, and qualitative interviews were held to understand acceptability of the trial. National Health Service maternity services and online input from service users. Healthcare professionals and women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes (currently pregnant or having birthed after active labour in past 3 years). There is significant variation in the recommended frequency of testing for gestational diabetes in labour, technologies used to test glucose levels in labour and administer insulin in type 1 diabetes mellitus, and in how neonatal hypoglycaemia is defined. Of surveyed women, 66% would be willing to participate in a future trial, with 23% unsure without further information. The service evaluation showed that once glucose testing had commenced, it was repeated after 1 hour in 18%, 2 hours in 38% and 4 hours in 45% of women. Neonatal hypoglycaemia was considered the most important neonatal outcome for a future trial, with maternal satisfaction the most important maternal outcome. The incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia (defined as glucose <\u20052.6\u00a0mmol\/l) was 47% in type 1 diabetes mellitus, 45% in type 2 diabetes mellitus and 16% in gestational diabetes mellitus. A non-inferiority trial to compare permissive versus intensive glucose control was designed to include all types of diabetes in an umbrella trial (conduct more than one trial simultaneously). Women and healthcare professionals considered the trial design acceptable and feasible, though noted important considerations in the design and conduct. Glucose levels may be poorly recorded in maternity notes and in practice tested more frequently than the study suggests. Sample sizes in some of the work packages were smaller than our pre-specified target, attrition in the Delphi survey was greater than anticipated and the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic impacting results. Willingness to participate in a hypothetical trial might not translate into recruitment to a real trial. An umbrella trial using a master protocol was designed to compare tight glycaemic control (standard care) with more permissive control in all types of diabetes. Such a trial is feasible and acceptable to women with lived experience of diabetes during pregnancy and by the women and healthcare professionals who took part in qualitative interviews. We recommend that a future randomised trial should include an internal pilot phase to test key aspects of trial conduct and clear progression criteria, given the challenges we have identified during this scoping study.

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine serum I-309 levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, as well as the association with clinical\/laboratory phenotypes and disease complications. A total of 155 T2DM patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. The concentrations of serum I-309, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 were measured. The relationships between I-309 and various clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed. The serum concentrations of I-309 were significantly higher in T2DM patients than in HC (P < 0.001). The serum I-309 levels were significantly elevated in T2DM patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, and diabetic ketosis (all P < 0.05), but reduced in drinkers (P = 0.018). The Spearman analysis showed that serum I-309 correlated positively with age, disease duration, CKD stages, urea, creatinine, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, C-reactive protein, red blood cell distribution width, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3, but negatively with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fasting blood glucose, total bilirubin, albumin, lymphocyte count, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin. The multiple linear regression analysis indicated that serum I-309 was independently correlated only with eGFR and IFN-\u03b3. The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that serum I-30 and IL-17A remained independently associated with DKD. Serum I-309 is markedly elevated in T2DM patients and is associated with increased DKD risk, suggesting its potential role as both a promising biomarker and a pathogenic mediator in the progression of T2DM, particularly DKD."

        "Abstract":"<i>Objective<\/i>. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) remains the gold standard for retinal vascular imaging, especially for detecting leakage, neovascularization, and ischemia, despite advancements in non-invasive techniques like optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and color fundus photography (CFP). FFA's unique role, particularly in late-phase imaging, is crucial for diagnosing and managing diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study introduces a novel dual-phase segmentation framework for FFA, enhancing the analysis of early and late-phase images. This study aims to overcome challenges such as noise and blurring in late-phase FFA by developing a method that enhances vascular map detection and monitors changes across two phases, enabling precise identification of lesions responsible for leakage. Validated through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics, this model enhances diagnostic accuracy for diabetic retinopathy and complements existing imaging technologies.<i>Approach<\/i>. A prospective randomized study of 280 images of 87 DR patients at various stages was included in this study. Our approach involved using four different image enhancement techniques including (1) histogram equalization (HE), (2) contrast limited adaptive HE (CLAHE), (3) recursive mean-square HE (RMSHE), and (4) the proposed method in this paper (CLAHE combined RMSHE). In addition, for robust noise reduction and edge sharpening in each enhancement method, combined median, match, and Hessian filters were used. Finally, four different thresholding methods, including, (i) C-means fuzzy thresholding, (ii) IsoData thresholding, (iii) modified active contour (MAC)+Otsu thresholding, and (iv) the proposed method in this paper (MAC+ IsoData) were used for vessel segmentation in FFA across different datasets.<i>Main results<\/i>. The most effective segmentation method, MAC+IsoData, was assessed using three metrics (DSC (early: 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, late: 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03), Jaccard index (early:0.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, late:0.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05), and Boundary F1 score (early: 0.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, late: 0.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02)). The results were validated by three expert ophthalmologists.<i>Significance<\/i>. This work demonstrates that MAC+Otsu, following CLAHE enhancement, effectively delineates details necessary for the precise identification of lesions responsible for leakage across two different phases. Additionally, MAC+IsoData, with the proposed method enhancement for early phases and RMSHE enhancement for late phases, successfully reveals the vascular map."

        "Abstract":"The Integrated Perinatal Diabetes Education and Management Program (IP-DEMP) was launched to improve outcomes of pregnant and postpartum individuals with diabetes at a large, urban academic hospital system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate treatment outcomes achieved by program participants. This retrospective cohort study compared diabetes treatment received by participants in the IP-DEMP with diabetes treatment in a historical comparison group at the same health care facility just before implementation of the IP-DEMP. Logistic regression was used to model the association of participation in the intervention with treatment, adjusting for covariates. A total of 355 people were included in the analysis. Descriptive characteristics were similar between the intervention and comparison groups. Among participants with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), participation in the intervention group significantly increases the likelihood of receiving insulin, the gold-standard therapy during pregnancy. No significant differences in therapy received were observed among participants with different racial and ethnic identities. People with GDM who participated in the IP-DEMP were more likely to receive insulin therapy. Treatment received was not different for participants from historically marginalized groups."

        "Abstract":"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represent a unique population characterized by poorer prognoses, which may be further exacerbated by mechanical complications. This study aims to develop a predictive model to identify high-risk individuals within this populations. This study enrolled AMI patients with T2DM and categorized them into complication and control groups. The mechanical complications were defined as papillary muscle rupture (with or without acute mitral regurgitation), ventricular septal defect, left ventricular pseudoaneurysm or aneurysm (with or without thrombus) and free wall rupture. Characteristics were selected using relaxed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression and random forest model. Selected variables were utilized to construct a nomogram to predict the possibility of mechanical complications. A total of 2,816 patients were enrolled, with 191 individuals classified into the complication group. Baseline analysis identified 31 factors exhibiting potential differences, which were subsequently employed for LASSO-logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression and random forest model. After comprehensive evaluation, nine variables emerged as predictive factors for mechanical complications, including gender, pulmonary hypertension, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, body mass index, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase, left ventricle ejection fraction and hemoglobin A1c, which were used to construct a reliable nomogram. The complication group also showed higher in-hospital mortality rates compared to controls, alerting the worse prognosis of these populations. This study identified nine factors upon admission that may be associated with mechanical complications during the hospitalization. A nomogram was developed based on these factors for clinical application. T2DM patients should emphasize glucose control, which may offer benefits following the onset of AMI."

        "Abstract":"Metabolic fatty liver disease is a common disease with numerous health risks. Life modification remains the primary treatment. Previous studies have shown that the sodium\u2012glucose cotransporter has a positive effect on improving fatty liver in individuals with diabetes mellitus, but it has not been extensively studied in nondiabetic patients with fatty liver. The aim of this study was to assess the immediate effects of empagliflozin in treating nondiabetic metabolic fatty liver disease. We conducted a prospective parallel-group open-label study on fifty-five nondiabetic metabolic fatty liver patients. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: twenty-two patients received lifestyle advice alone (L-arm), and thirty-three patients received lifestyle advice plus empagliflozin 10 mg daily (LE-arm). After 6 months, non-invasive elastography (fibro-scan) was used to check for changes in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Body mass index, waist circumference, arterial blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and lipid profiles were also used to measure metabolic outcomes. The LE-arm showed a mean CAP reduction of 38 dB\/m compared to 8 dB\/m in the L-arm (p = 0.001). Moreover, there was a slight improvement in liver fibrosis, as well as improvements in metabolic measures such as blood pressure (p value 0.034), waist circumference (p value 0.01), and weight reduction (2.5 kg vs. 1 kg, p value 0.022). Along with lifestyle changes, empagliflozin may improve hepatic steatosis and the metabolic profile in nondiabetic fatty liver patients. However, conducting a longer term risk\u2012benefit analysis requires more research. NCT05694923 at 2023-01-19."

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and increased arterial stiffness, both of which have been independently linked to declining renal function in diabetic nephropathy. This study aims to investigate whether arterial stiffness mediates the relationship between systemic inflammation and renal function in patients with T2DM, potentially revealing a novel pathophysiological pathway. In this cross-sectional study of 307 T2DM patients, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated as an inflammatory marker, ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) was derived from 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the relationships between NLR, AASI, and eGFR. Mediation analysis with bootstrap resampling (5000 replications) was performed to assess whether AASI mediated the association between NLR and eGFR. Patients with lower eGFR had significantly higher NLR and AASI than those with higher eGFR. After adjusting for confounders, both NLR (\u03b2 = -8.27, 95% CI: -12.32 to -4.22, P < 0.001) and AASI (\u03b2 = -22.55, 95% CI: -43.67 to -1.43, P = 0.037) were independently associated with reduced eGFR. Mediation analysis revealed that AASI accounted for 8.17% of the total effect in the fully adjusted model (mediation effect: -0.717, 95% CI: -1.570 to -0.067, P = 0.024), demonstrating a partial mediation of the relationship between NLR and eGFR. AASI partially mediates the association between NLR and eGFR in T2DM patients, providing new insights into the pathophysiological links between inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and kidney damage. Therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation and arterial stiffness might offer synergistic benefits for preserving renal function."

This study assessed the prevalence, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical determinants of hypertension among sedentary workers in the Cape Coast Metropolis. <b>Methods:<\/b> A cross-sectional study was conducted among 170 sedentary workers at Abura Market, Cape Coast. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were assessed. Data was analyzed accordingly using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26 (IBM Inco., United States). <b>Results:<\/b> The study involved 170 participants, of which 127 were females [median\u2009age = 42]. The prevalence of hypertension was found to be 18.2% (31\/170). Increased consumption of alcohol, engagement in physical activity, fruit intake, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio were observed among hypertensive participants compared to those without hypertension. An increased risk of hypertension incidence was found to be significantly associated with age (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001), having a family history of hypertension (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001), and experiencing shortness of breath (<i>p<\/i> = 0.011) in a multivariate analysis. Having a family history of hypertension and experiencing shortness of breath increase the odds of an individual developing hypertension by 23.9 and 9.49-fold. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> The study reveals a higher prevalence of hypertension among sedentary workers. High-risk groups for hypertension include the aged, those with a family history of hypertension, and those with diabetes mellitus. Given the lack of statistically significant symptoms, hypertension may remain undetected in individuals. The findings therefore underscore the need for public health interventions."

A retrospective review was conducted on patients diagnosed with postoperative endophthalmitis over a 20-year period. The collected data included demographic characteristics, endophthalmitis classification, causative organisms, treatment modalities, and final visual acuity. Factors associated with improved visual outcomes were explored. This study included 163 eyes (163 patients). Eighty-seven cases (53.4%) were acute-onset, while the rest were delayed-onset. Cataract surgery was the most common prior intraocular procedure. Microorganisms were identified by culture in 29.4% of cases. Coagulase-negative <i>Staphylococcus<\/i> species were predominant among acute-onset cases (57.7%), followed by <i>Enterococcus faecalis<\/i> (15.4%); coagulase-negative <i>Staphylococcus<\/i> species also were predominant among delayed-onset cases (18.9%). The most common treatment was immediate pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreal injection. Significant improvements in visual acuity (VA) were observed in the immediate and delayed PPV groups, with mean improvements of 0.80 logMAR (p < 0.001) and 0.87 logMAR (p = 0.001), respectively.

        "Abstract":"Platelet abnormalities are well-recognized complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). High glucose (HG) increases platelet mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and hyperreactivity in T2DM, which underlie the occurrence of thrombotic events. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a dietary isothiocyanate enriched in cruciferous vegetables and possesses multiple biological activities. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of SFN on platelet dysfunction in HG-stimulated human platelets <i>in vitro<\/i>. Washed human platelets from healthy donors were pre-incubated with SFN (5, 10, or 20 \u03bcM) or vehicle control (0.05% DMSO) for 40 min at 37\u00b0C, with or without pharmacologic inhibitors (apalrestat, PP2, N-acetyl-cysteine, pifithrin-\u03bc). Platelets were then stimulated with normal glucose (NG, 5 mM) or HG (25 mM) for an additional 90 min. Functional assays were performed to evaluate SFN efficacy and investigate its underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated that SFN attenuated HG-induced platelet dysfunction by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction (manifested as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; <i>p<\/i> <\u202f0.001), apoptosis (characterized by increased caspase-9\/-3 activation and phosphatidylserine exposure; <i>p<\/i> <\u202f0.01), and hyperreactivity (evidenced by enhanced aggregation and activation; <i>p<\/i> <\u202f0.05). Mechanistically, SFN significantly suppressed HG-induced aldose reductase (AR) activity (<i>p<\/i> <\u202f0.001). Pharmacological inhibition revealed that the beneficial effects of SFN on platelet function were mediated mechanistically through AR downregulation, which attenuated p53 phosphorylation via Src-dependent ROS generation. These findings suggest that by inhibiting the Src\/ROS\/p53 signaling pathway and mitigating AR-mediated platelet dysfunction, SFN may confer significant protection against atherothrombosis during hyperglycemia."

        "Abstract":"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a severe and prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus, posing substantial risks to patient health and increasing healthcare burdens globally. These chronic wounds often result from a complex interplay of factors, including neuropathy, ischemia, infection, immune dysregulation, and vascular dysfunction, leading to significant morbidity and, in severe cases, amputation. Effective management of DFUs necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their risk factors and prognostic indicators. This review provides an in-depth examination of the various risk factors and prognostic markers associated with DFUs, integrating insights from cellular mechanisms, emerging biomarkers, omics-based research, serological studies, and clinical assessments. We explore the underlying biological processes, such as the impact of chronic hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, impaired angiogenesis, and the role of the microbiome in DFU development. The role of serological markers, including inflammatory and glycemic indicators, in predicting DFU risk and progression is discussed. Additionally, clinical markers and advanced assessment tools, such as ulcer grading systems and imaging technologies, used to evaluate DFU severity and healing are reviewed. By synthesizing these diverse perspectives, this review aims to offer a holistic view of DFU management, highlighting how understanding the interplay of risk factors and prognostic markers can lead to improved prevention strategies and personalized therapeutic interventions."

        "Abstract":"Children in the developing stages whine for a variety of reasons. It can serve as a way of communicating when they cannot express their needs or feelings verbally. They may whine to seek attention or to deal with discomfort and frustration, especially when they want something but aren't getting it quickly enough. Additionally, it can be a response to unfamiliar stress, lack of sleep, uncomfortable environment, conflicts with siblings, or separation anxiety. Whining is common in children, usually peaking in toddlers and preschoolers. Depending on how parents respond to the behavior, some children may continue to whine beyond this age. Whining can also occur in elderly patients, especially those with dementia, and may be triggered by physical pain, hunger, psychological distress, or overstimulation in their environment. Whining is usually considered a form of behavior and not a sign of illness. Ignoring it is one option recommended for dealing with it, but rarely, it could be made to signal danger, fear, pain, or some significant underlying illness. However, persistent, unexplained whining shouldn't be simply ignored. We present a case of Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), where the primary symptom was whining in a toddler who required multiple visits to the clinic and emergency department before a diagnosis was made. Whining was not initially recognized as a severe indicator of illness in this patient. To our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes mellitus with DKA in a child whose main complaint was whining."

However, research on predictive models for the MACE risk in DF patients is not sufficient. The purpose of this study is to construct a prognostic model for the MACE risk in patients with diabetic foot ulcers and provide a reference tool for clinical individualized management. This study retrospectively collected data of DF patients who were hospitalized and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria in a tertiary first-class comprehensive hospital mainly engaged in metabolic diseases in Tianjin from January 2018 to January 2020. The follow-up outcome was the occurrence of MACE within 5 years after discharge. Multiple imputation (MI) method was used to fill in the missing data. Based on the processed data, in terms of modeling methods, the top three frequently used methods were used. Logistic regression, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) were used respectively to analyze influencing factors. The performance of each model was compared by using confusion matrix, ROC curve and AUC value. The data set was divided into training set and test set according to the proportion of 80%\/20%. Finally, the model effect was verified on the test set. The study finally included a total of 504 patients with DF. Among them, 147 cases (29.17%) experienced MACE events within five years. The AUC of the RF model in this study was 0.70, the AUC of the Logistic regression model was 0.62, and the AUC of the SVM model was 0.60. All three models established in this research have good clinical predictive ability. Among them, the clinical prediction model based on RF has the best effect and can effectively predict the risk of MACE in DF patients, helping clinical medical staff formulate personalized treatment plans."

Finally, a pilot test was conducted to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability. Learning objectives were set in the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains, with a total of 189 items. The program consisted of five sessions, including: understanding GDM, nutrition and physical activity guidelines, expecting moms-are you ready, postpartum weight management, and reinforcing healthy behaviors. In addition, there was a session specifically for women starting insulin treatment, with the theme: timely insulin injection. Teaching materials included lesson plans, teaching posters, food cards, and a mother's handbook, etc., totaling 11 items. The pilot study included eight women with GDM, all of whom expressed a positive acceptance of the program. The feasibility and acceptability of the program were confirmed, and a final version was developed. It features clear objectives, detailed teaching content, engaging teaching materials, and standardized implementation processes, all of which are of significant importance for both short- and long-term management of GDM."

        "Abstract":"Limited evidence supports the use of electronic health records for developing prediction models to identify high-risk plaques in patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP). This study aimed to develop and validate a practical high-risk plaque prediction model in patients with new onset UAP. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients presenting with new-onset UAP who underwent both coronary angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at our center from January 2021 to December 2021. Based on the CCTA findings, the patients were categorized into two distinct groups: a high-risk plaque group (n=57) and a low-risk plaque group (n=26). We utilized LASSO regression and the Boruta algorithm for feature selection and performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify variables associated with high-risk plaque. Internal validity of the predictive model was assessed using bootstrapping (500 replications). We developed a nomogram to predict high-risk plaque likelihood using LASSO regression, the Boruta algorithm, and multivariate logistic regression analyses. This approach identified four clinical features as significant predictors: diabetes mellitus, current smoking, total cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) values, calculated using the bootstrap method with 500 replicates, for evaluating high-risk plaque in both the development and validation cohorts, were 0.851, accompanied by a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) ranging from 0.768 to 0.935. The nomogram exhibited satisfactory calibration when assessed with the bootstrap method (500 replicates), indicating a strong correlation with high-risk plaque as determined by CCTA. Furthermore, decision curve analysis indicated the clinical utility of this nomogram in accurately predicting high-risk plaque. And a web-based dynamic nomogram was further built to facilitate the prediction procedure. Our prediction nomogram, developed using electronic health records, demonstrated robust capability in accurately identifying high-risk plaque among new onset patients with UAP. The implementation of this predictive tool holds great potential for tailoring individualized treatment strategies."

        "Abstract":"Obesity and physical inactivity exacerbate type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas regular exercise improves glycemic control, fitness, and quality of life. However, many patients face barriers to attending clinic-based exercise programs. Digital health interventions could increase access and adherence by enabling guided outdoor exercise via smartphone. It remains unclear if a digital program can achieve outcomes comparable to traditional supervised exercise in obese adults with T2DM. We aimed to evaluate the noninferiority of a 12-week digital outdoor exercise program, delivered via mobile app, compared to a standard clinic-based exercise intervention in obese adults with T2DM. The primary outcome was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), physical fitness, and quality of life. Adherence and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. We conducted a randomized controlled noninferiority trial at a single tertiary center. A total of 240 obese adults with T2DM were randomly assigned to either the digital outdoor exercise program (DOE) or a clinic-based exercise program (CBE). The digital intervention provided personalized aerobic and resistance exercise routines via a smartphone app with remote coaching, while the clinic group attended on-site supervised exercise sessions of similar frequency and intensity. Outcomes were measured at baseline and 12 weeks. The noninferiority margin for HbA1c was set at 0.4%. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A total of 240 obese adults with T2DM were randomized equally into DOE and CBE groups. After 24 weeks, both groups achieved significant, comparable reductions in HbA1c (DOE: -1.56 \u00b1 0.17%, CBE: -1.50 \u00b1 0.17%), BMI, waist circumference, and improved physical fitness, with no significant between-group differences. The DOE intervention demonstrated significantly lower costs (14,787.30 CNY) compared to CBE (17,920.05 CNY; p<0.001). Adherence was high in both groups, with similarly low adverse event rates. The 12-week smartphone-based outdoor exercise program was noninferior to a clinic-based program in improving HbA1c and BMI, and it produced similar gains in fitness and quality of life in obese adults with T2DM. Higher adherence in the digital intervention and its lower delivery cost indicate that digital exercise programs can be a cost-effective, scalable alternative to clinic-based interventions for managing T2DM. https:\/\/www.chictr.org.cn\/, identifier ChiCTR2500104389."

        "Abstract":"Glucagon, once seen as an insulin counter-regulatory hormone, is now recognized as a key regulator of systemic energy balance, with expanding relevance across a spectrum of cardiometabolic diseases. While its traditional roles in liver glucose regulation are well established, new evidence highlights glucagon's involvement in amino acid metabolism, fat oxidation, appetite control, heat production, and cardiovascular health. Nonetheless, the broader effects of glucagon imbalance, especially in cases of \u03b1-cell overactivity and glucagon resistance, are still not fully understood in chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity, and hypertension. This mini-review consolidates current knowledge of glucagon signaling, highlighting its regulatory mechanisms, multi-organ metabolic functions, and emerging therapeutic approaches. We suggest that long-term changes in glucagon secretion could be an upstream factor driving diabetic complications affecting the liver, kidney, and cardiovascular system. By incorporating recent discoveries, we aim to establish a conceptual basis for future translational research on glucagon's systemic effects within the framework of diabetic cardiometabolic dysfunction."

Several studies have suggested differences in etiology and risk factors between these two complications. To examine whether diabetic retinopathy (DR) and nephropathy (DN) have significant concordance in terms of severity progression in patients with type 2 diabetes. A case-control study was conducted involving two cohorts of type 2 diabetic patients from a New Mexican population. The cases had confirmed end-stage renal disease (ESRD; Stage 5, on dialysis, <b>e<\/b>GFR < 15 mL\/min, n = 164), while the controls had mild diabetic nephropathy (DN) (Stage 1 or Stage 2, <b>e<\/b>GFR > 60 mL\/min, n = 165). Systemic parameters were collected through retrospective chart reviews, which included HbA1c, blood pressure (BP), lipid levels, serum creatinine (Cr), and retinopathy status determined by dilated fundus examinations. Statistical analyses were conducted, encompassing univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses for continuous variables, as well as a Chi-squared test for categorical variables. The majority (65%) of the ESRD cohort had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), while 18% of patients exhibited no diabetic retinopathy (DR) or mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Conversely, approximately 38% of the mild DN cohort had PDR. In the univariate analysis, ESRD was significantly associated with lower HbA1c levels (p<0.0001) and higher systolic blood pressure (p<0.0001). Within the ESRD cohort, the onset of PDR was significantly linked to younger age (p=0.0002), higher diastolic blood pressure (p=0.0319), and elevated LDL (p=0.0361). In the multivariate analysis, the development of PDR was inversely related to age (p=0.001, OR=0.95) and positively correlated with serum creatinine (p<0.0001, OR=1.25), systolic blood pressure (p=0.0221, OR=1.023), and albuminuria (p=0.0006, OR=4.65). HbA1c levels showed no significant correlation with the progression of PDR. The use of PDR as a screening tool for chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a sensitivity of 78.68% and a specificity of 51.16%, indicating that it is a suboptimal screening method. Our findings suggest discordance between the progression of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy."

        "Abstract":"Recent advances in automated insulin delivery (AID) system have been remarkable. The advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) system made it easier to achieve optimal glycemic targets. According to previous studies, the AHCL system achieves relatively good glycemic control without strict carbohydrate input. These studies suggested that AID systems potentially improve glycemic control among patients with difficulty with self-management. However, few studies have focused on the efficacy of the systems among these patients. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes and intellectual disabilities (full-scale intelligence quotient = 67) due to Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. While using a sensor-augmented pump with the predictive low glucose suspend system, her glycated hemoglobin levels consistently ranged from 9.0% to 10.0%, and she experienced frequent hospitalizations due to diabetic ketoacidosis. Stepping up to a hybrid closed-loop system achieved better glycemic control and prevented hospitalizations due to diabetic ketoacidosis. Finally, the patient achieved optimal glycemic control through the use of the AHCL system. Our case highlights the potential of AID systems in patients with type 1 diabetes and self-management difficulties, including those with intellectual disabilities."

Developing nations face particular difficulties with the concurrent presence of diabetes and high blood pressure, problems intensified by poor nutrition habits, lack of physical exercise, and continuing high rates of illnesses like HIV\/AIDS and malaria. A significant data gap in primary healthcare (PHC) data has been determined and prioritized by governments seeking to assess and enhance the prevention and management of chronic disease. The main aim of the current study is to determine factors related to hypertension among patients with type 2 diabetes in public PHC facilities in Southern Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 6 March 2023 to 5 April 2023 among 409 patients with diabetes. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. The data were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi-data version 4.6.0.2 and exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. For descriptive statistics, both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed. Variables with a <i>p<\/i>-value <0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were declared as significantly associated with outcome variables. A total of 407 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included in the current study with a response rate of 99.5%, and the mean age of the study participants was 57.1 years (SD \u00b19.91). The prevalence of hypertension among patients with T2DM was 66.1% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 59.9-70.3.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) Imeglimin alone, (2) Imeglimin with metformin, (3) Imeglimin with other oral hypoglycemic agents, and (4) Metformin with other oral hypoglycemic agents. Clinical and metabolic parameters, mtDNA copy number, and relative telomere length were assessed at baseline and six months. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and mixed models. The study included participants with a mean age of 55.6 years (57% male, BMI 28.8 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>). HbA1c significantly decreased in the Imeglimin + Other OHA (p < 0.001), Imeglimin + Metformin (p < 0.001), and Metformin + Other OHA (p < 0.001) groups, with a smaller but significant decrease in the Imeglimin monotherapy group (p = 0.04). mtDNA copy number increased significantly in the Imeglimin-based combination groups (p < 0.05) but not with monotherapy (p = 0.18). No serious adverse events were reported. Relative telomere length was only associated with age and changes in LDL-c levels. Imeglimin-based combination therapy effectively improves glycemic control and mitochondrial function, while monotherapy offers limited benefits. Combination therapy may be preferable for optimizing metabolic outcomes in T2DM. No significant change in telomere length was observed during the short period of time."

We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 69 T2DM patients, employing three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI scans to measure brain tissue volumes, particularly gwJTV, and analyzing blood samples for metabolic parameters. Voxel-based (VBA) and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses of gwJTV were performed to evaluate the group difference with and without carotid artery plaques and to determine correlations to metabolic biomarkers. Voxel-based and region-of-interest analyses revealed that participants with carotid plaques had lower gwJTV than those without at the specific brain area. ROI results study further demonstrated positive associations between gwJTV and metabolic parameters such as AST, ApoB, and LDL, and negative associations with C-peptide, creatinine, and hsCRP.

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted involving 2,357 patients with T2DM (1,120 males and 1,237 females) who were hospitalized at Wuxi Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine between 2018 and 2024. Participants were categorized into the SCH (n=196) and the euthyroid subgroups (n=2,161). The 10-year probability of cardiovascular events was estimated based on the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) model. Sex-specific differences in SCH prevalence and CVD risk were examined, and associations between FRS and biomarkers-namely thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), cystatin C (CysC) and other factors-were analyzed via Spearman's correlation analysis and multivariable linear regression. The prevalence of SCH in T2DM patients was 9.06% (10.02% in females vs. 6.43% in males). Male patients diagnosed with SCH exhibited an elevated FRS compared to their euthyroid counterparts (21.00 vs. 20.00, <i>P=<\/i> 0.025). Within this subgroup, a positive relationship was identified between TSH levels and FRS(r=0.374, <i>P=<\/i> 0.001), whereas FT4 showed a negative association (<i>r=<\/i>-0.342, <i>P=<\/i> 0.003). These relationships were not statistically significant among women diagnosed with SCH.

Multivariable linear regression evaluation in male patients revealed that TSH (<i>\u03b2=<\/i>3.87, <i>P=<\/i> 0.048), cystatin C (<i>\u03b2=<\/i>1.48, <i>P=<\/i> 0.03), and FT4 (<i>\u03b2=<\/i>-0.61, <i>P=<\/i> 0.011) continued to be significantly correlated with 10-year CVD risk. Additionally, male patients with SCH exhibited significantly higher smoking status, uric acid, and creatinine levels than their female counterparts (all <i>P<<\/i>0.05), indicating that sex-specific risk factors may contribute to elevated CVD risk. This study identified higher FRS in male versus female patients with comorbid T2DM and SCH, potentially mediated by sex-specific variations in TSH, FT4, and CysC levels. These results underscore the importance of implementing sex-specific strategies for CVD risk management in this population."

A crucial factor in selecting a cell compatible bioink, that maintains islet functionality, is the mesh size and diffusion capacity of the bioink. In this study, we present a screening strategy for alginate hydrogel formulations in three-dimensional bioprinting, utilizing the fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method and measuring the mesh size of the hydrogels. Subsequently, the 1.5\u00a0% alginate formulation that had been selected was used to bioprint the INS1E cell line, primary rat islets, or human islets. It was demonstrated that cell viability and functionality were maintained in all cell sources. This was evidenced by the observation that bioprinted pancreatic islets exhibited a response to physiological glucose levels. The present study indicates that both FRAP and hydrogel mesh size measurements are effective tools for predicting the diffusion of hormones through a hydrogel. These measures should therefore be incorporated into future screenings of hydrogel compositions for the 3D bioprinting of islets."

Meanwhile, the initial data on subjects was taken in 1997 (Age 0-23 months) and observed at 3-5, then 17-19 years. This study used a generalized linear model with a 95% confidence interval for bivariate and multivariate analysis. <b>Results:<\/b> The results showed a significant association between rapid growth after retardation at the FDLs and an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity in adolescents. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> The impact of rapid growth after retardation at the FDL increases the long-term risk of NCDs in later life. Early life interventions and policies focused on preventing undernutrition, ensuring a balanced diet, and regularly monitoring growth during the critical period."

        "Title":"Association Between Serum Lycopene Concentrations and Diabetic Kidney Disease in the Elderly With Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross-Sectional Study From the NHANES Database.",
        "Abstract":"This study is aimed at assessing the association between serum lycopene and its isomers with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in order patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) cycles 2003-2006 and 2017-2018. Metrics including serum lycopene, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were collected. Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to explore the associations between serum lycopene isomers and DKD in order patients with DM. Subgroup analyses were conducted by different genders, complications, and medical history. A total of 960 order patients with DM were included, of whom 470 (48.96%) had DKD. After covariate adjustment, we found a <i>cis<\/i>-lycopene concentration range of 8.60-13.19\u2009<i>\u03bc<\/i>g\/dL (Q1-Q2) was associated with lower odds of DKD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.28-0.98). This association was particularly evident among males (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25-0.93), patients with a history of hypertension (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24-0.97), patients with dyslipidemia (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.27-0.99), and those without the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI\/ARB) use (OR = 0.55, 95% CI; 0.31-0.99). No significant associations were observed between total lycopene, translycopene, and DKD. These findings suggest serum <i>cis<\/i>-lycopene may be a potential modifiable biomarker for DKD prevention in high-risk elderly populations. Concentrations may improve renal health among the elderly DM patients. Maintaining optimal <i>cis<\/i>-lycopene levels through dietary interventions may complement conventional renoprotective strategies. Further prospective studies are warranted to establish causal relationships and evaluate targeted lycopene supplementation regimens."

        "Title":"Bariatric surgery in the Armed Forces: Reshaping the SHAPE!",
        "Abstract":"The Indian Armed Forces is an extremely fit fighting force. However, due to some factors like injuries or lack of physical activities, a very small percentage of serving population, who fall under the morbidly obese category, is offered bariatric surgery if diet changes and exercises fail to achieve satisfactory weight reduction. In the absence of a study to look into this cohort who have undergone bariatric surgery, a need is felt to estimate the effects of bariatric surgery on body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities and employability of these patients. This is a retrospective study of patients, who underwent bariatric surgery over a ten-year period at a service hospital with super specialty services and followed-up for a period of minimum of a year after the surgery. The study included a total of 35 patients. Their mean body weight and BMI reduced significantly as compared to the pre-operative status. Though there was a significant improvement in the control of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001) and obstructive sleep apnoea (p = 0.002); hypertension, though fared better, failed to achieve a statistical significant value (p = 0.074) after the surgery. Twenty-eight (80 %) of patients returned back to their active duties. Bariatric surgery stands as a valid option for management of obese patients with good clinical outcomes and no major morbidity and mortality was observed in the 30-day post-operative period."

        "Title":"Comparison of the efficacy of 12 interventions in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers: a network meta-analysis.",
        "Abstract":"This study aimed to comprehensively compare the efficacy of 12 interventions for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) using a network meta-analysis (NMA). The NMA was conducted by PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023461811). PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were systematically searched from inception to September 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients with DFU were included if they compared epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), stem cells (SC), low-frequency ultrasound (LFU), negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), low-level laser therapy (LLLT), electric stimulation (ES), extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), amniotic membrane therapy (AMT), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), and topical oxygen therapy (TOT) against standard of care (SOC) or placebo. The primary endpoint assessed was the wound healing rate. Secondary endpoints comprised wound healing time, percentage area reduction (PAR), and amputation rate. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated to rank the efficacy of interventions. A total of 99 RCTs involving 7,356 patients were included. Among the 12 interventions analyzed, only LFU (OR = 2.20; 95% CI [0.99-4.91]) and ES (OR = 1.88; 95% CI [0.87-4.05]) did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in ulcer healing rate compared with SOC. Based on SUCRA rankings, SC (SUCRA = 89.7%; OR = 5.71; 95% CI [2.64-12.34]) and AMT (SUCRA = 89.2%; OR = 5.11; 95% CI [3.12-8.37]) ranked highest in promoting ulcer healing, while LFU (29.4%) and SOC (10.4%) ranked lowest. Regarding wound healing time, AMT (MD = -26.91 days; 95% CI [-44.27 to -9.55]), PRP (MD = -21.65 days; 95% CI [-33.61 to -9.69]), and NPWT (MD = -16.79 days; 95% CI [-31.12 to -2.26]) significantly reduced healing durations compared to SOC. SUCRA rankings indicated that AMT (84.7%) and PRP (74.6%) ranked highest, while LFU (29.4%) and SOC (10.4%) remained lowest. Concerning PAR, LLLT (MD = 34.27; 95% CI [17.35-51.20]) and ESWT (MD = 27.50; 95% CI [11.00-44.00]) showed significant improvements over SOC, with LLLT (SUCRA = 93.9%) and ESWT (SUCRA = 84.0%) ranking highest, while SOC (21.0%) and TOT (18.3%) ranked lowest. For amputation rate, SC (OR = 0.12; 95% CI [0.03-0.55]) and HBOT (OR = 0.35; 95% CI [0.16-0.78]) significantly lowered the risk compared to SOC, with SUCRA rankings placing SC (79.9%) and PRP (73.2%) as most effective, while NPWT (26.4%) and SOC (9.9%) were least effective. SC and AMT emerged as highly effective, demonstrating superior efficacy in improving healing rate compared to PDGF, ES, and HBOT. AMT also showed significant effects in shortening ulcer healing time. LLLT exhibited considerable effectiveness in reducing ulcer areas, and SC therapy was associated with reduced amputation rate."
